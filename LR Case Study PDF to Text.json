Liferay was chosen because of the light-weight, open standard web platform and flexibility to enable rapid development.www.abc.net.au\/educationIn briefindustry:Educationcountry\/region:Australiause case:CMSkey features:Rich Video and Audio Content, Open Standards Web Platform, Social Media Out-of-the-Box\f2180222Project aims and visionA significant amount of the content delivered on ABC\u00a0Education is rich video and audio materials and live events, therefore, the site needed to be delivered on a light-weight, open standard web platform which would enable rapid development and flexibility.The site also needed to appeal to a broad audience, students ranging in age from five to 16, teachers and parents, and have organised and searchable content delivered in an engaging way for all users.In addition, the digital platform needed to:\u2022 Use and promote the capability of the National Broadband Network\u2022 Provide engaging and immersive digital learning experiences to engage students and parents in the home\u2022 Deliver a wealth of digital media clips, content and interactive tools which align to the Australian national curriculum\u2022 Ensure the ABC fulfils its charter obligation to educate and inform AustraliansChoosing the platformA critical success factor in the deployment of the project was the short time to deliver. The flexibility of the Liferay platform and out-of-the-box functionality were key factors in the selection of Liferay and enabled ABC\u00a0Digital\u00a0Education to meet their target delivery dates.There was a rapid implementation, from signing in June to a live product in just over five months with 300 pieces of content live from day one. ABC\u00a0Education now has more than 4000 pieces of content.The Liferay platform provides flexibility and extensibility for building customised functionality and capacity for future extension and integration. Many features required for the ABC\u00a0Educationdigital platform, such as social media capabilities, are supported out of the box, so significantly less development resources and time are required to develop. The destination for Australian educationABC\u00a0Education offers a world-class education experience and all resources are free to watch and play at home and in school and guaranteed to spark discussion and promote curiosity.Development within the Liferay framework ensured a consistent and predictable output and reduced management overhead. The Liferay technology has enabled the ABC team to continually update the site and now some time on from when the site launched it is still fresh and engaging for students, teachers and parents who visit the site regularly. ABC\u00a0Education has become an indispensable resource to help transform learning in the classroom. For students, it is the go to place for helpful, fun and informative content in a world that is media rich and a space to create and collaborate.The feedback from teachers across Australia has all been positive and included praise for the sites accessibility, ease of use, and suitability for Australian students.Since the site\u2019s launch partnerships with the National Archives of Australia, Museum of Contemporary Art (Sydney), Australian War Memorial, The National Portrait Gallery, and National Museum of Australia have been established to supplement existing content.These partnerships deliver selected content from the institutions\u2019 exhibitions and collections to teachers and students through the site \u2013 providing rarely seen archival documents, artefacts and artworks \u2013 bringing day-to-day lessons to life.The ABC\u00a0Education team is now focused on increasing audience reach to more teachers and students.\f"},{"filename":"Adama Case Study_final.pdf","text":"Liferay is an innovative and user-friendly platform that provides the necessary scalability and flexibility we were looking for to reach our digital goals.Georgiana Francescotti Digital & Knowledge Services, Information & Digital TechnologyChallenges\u2022 Migrate more than 50 local websites without affecting users\u2022 Integrate multiple third-party applications\u2022 Needed a training and support plan for web editors and suppliers\u2022 Existing CMS required user experience improvements  and customizationResultsIndIvIdual Page desIgnWeb editors can customize existing pages based on their local needseffIcIent self-servIceLiferay\u2019s advanced technology stack provides the scalability to make the public website available 24\/7 worldwidefull resPonsIvenessPublic website is now responsive for all common mobile devicesIncreased usabIlItyIntuitive guidance empowers users to master the new system in a heartbeatSummaryAdama, a global agricultural company, needed to migrate  its content from an aging  Content Management System.  Together with PRODYNA,  the company used Liferay to develop a customized platform that improved usability and aligned to Adama\u2019s digital roadmap to reach the global agriculture market.adama.comIn BriefIndustry:Agriculturecountry\/regIon:Globaluse case:Content Management System, Public Websitekey features:Web Content Management, Systems Integration,  Single-Sign-On, MultilingualUpgrading Content Management  for a Modern ExperienceA flexible CMS empowered Adama to transition its legacy systems seamlessly\f2Bringing Simplicity to AgricultureAdama, one of the world\u2019s leading crop protection companies, has a straightforward goal: to grow simply together with its customer base of farmers in more than 100 countries around the globe. Adama\u2019s team of over 6,000 employees provides farmers with solutions \u2014 herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, plant growth regulators and seed treatments \u2013 that improve the quality and quantity of their crop yields by protecting them from weeds, insects and diseases. With a heritage going back 70 years, Adama is one of the largest companies in the $60 billion global crop protection industry and the only integrated Global-China crop protection company, with sales in 2016 of $3.35 billion. Reimagining an Aging SolutionIn order to stay relevant to its customer base, Adama decided to roll out a comprehensive rebrand to its corporate website. This included more than 50 local country sites, as well as micro product sites in about 40 languages. The entire public website would remain online, but the look and feel of every page needed to be updated according to the new guidelines.To achieve this, Adama\u2019s team introduced an ambitious digital roadmap that would allow them to implement the new sites without interrupting day-to-day operations. The team needed to manage  simultaneous training as well for nearly 100 web editors spread across the globe so they could continue to publish new content during the migration period. This made the introduction  of the new platform even more challenging.The company quickly realized that the existing Content Management System (CMS) wasn\u2019t up to  the task. It was too time-consuming to migrate content and had a poor user experience for web editors. Adama decided to replace the legacy CMS with the Liferay platform, which provided the necessary flexibility and customizations along with high scalability and excellent user experience. A Future-Proof  Digital FoundationTogether with its strategic partner PRODYNA, Adama developed the solution on Liferay with an agile approach. It was critical to develop the customized CMS features in Liferay and to migrate the existing content seamlessly without any downtime to the new site.During the project, the team discovered more than 30 different web components, 20 different page templates, and 10 custom applications and forms that needed to be available in Liferay.  The team was able to develop all these requested features with Liferay\u2019s out-of-the-box functionality, such as Web Content Structures, predefined Page Templates and a Contact Us Portlet. Leveraging the existing functionality made it much faster to implement the new CMS, since the team had to create very little from scratch. One of the greatest \f3190322gains was the instant publishing feature, which would enable Adama to reach its customers in a matter  of seconds.Furthermore, third-party solutions such as ADFS for Single-Sign-On or the Asset Management Platform PicturePark were integrated into Adama\u2019s solution, allowing the team to maintain its current processes for identity management and its digital product catalog. The team orchestrated the existing content migration and web editor training in four region-based waves. PRODYNA trained each wave onsite with a professional and experienced trainer,  based on step-by-step documentation that was created during the project development.After their training, web editors reviewed the migrated content page by page and approved the overall migration for each site. Once the site owners gave the final approval, the migrated pages were published and swapped using an intelligent configuration of the existing load balancer. In addition to the onsite training, PRODYNA introduced a multilingual service desk to ensure that web editors could reach out to somebody  in case they got stuck during any of the new  CMS processes. Finally, to encourage momentum and ensure that web editors feel supported, the team runs bi-monthly training webinars, focusing on new features or questions that editors have asked.Improved User Experience for Employees and CustomersThe Liferay platform provides Adama with more flexibility and empowers its web editors to  create custom pages based on their local needs while following the global brand guidelines.  Today, Adama is able to deliver personalized  online experiences to its customers faster without concern that one region will present a different brand look than others. Customers are able to easily review Adama\u2019s products on a modern,  user-friendly site that integrates features like  live chat to offer help as soon as they need it.Adama has more features planned for its  corporate site, which can be easily implemented based on the out-of-the-box functionality of Liferay and enhanced with custom portlets, ensuring that Adama has exactly the CMS it needs for its business. \u201cLiferay is an innovative and user-friendly platform that provides the necessary scalability and flexibility  we were looking for to reach our digital goals,\u201d  says Georgiana Francescotti, part of the Information  & Digital Technology team at Adama.

Advanced Energy has regional centers in three continents with 1400 employees and revenue over $400 million. Moving from Silos to Efficient CommunicationAs a global manufacturer of highly complex products that include thousands of components, Advanced Energy had no centralized system in place to collaborate with its suppliers.  They relied on a silo approach to communicate in which each method was independent of one another. Fax, email, and phone communications were each used separately to assure crucial workflow information such as forecast and purchase order commitments were relayed back and forth. Moreover, critical changes driven by material requirement planning were slowly communicated with very little collaboration between departments. This lowered the likelihood of meeting certain requirement deadlines, which resulted in manufacturing delays. High human touch point levels significantly reduced both client and client suppliers\u2019 opportunity for efficiency and increased margin of error. In terms of technical challenges, Advanced Energy was looking for a product that could integrate with their legacy SAP Netweaver platform. The legacy systems did not have necessary functionality to solve the constraints placed on the current system and would have been very expensive to modify. As a result, the new solution would have to complement the underlying SAP functionality while keeping associated costs down.Advanced Energy Leader in plasma manufacturing pulls off key system integration.In BriefCompany: Advanced Energy Country\/Region:  US Industry:  Energy, Manufacturing & Hi-Tech Use Case:  Collaboration platform, extranet\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY + CIGNEX CASE STUDY151020Launching a Well-Integrated CollaborationWith the help of CIGNEX Datamatics, Advanced Energy decided to adopt and integrate  Liferay Portal along with their legacy SAP ECC portal. The integration would be carried out via SAP\u2019s Process Integration component.After heavy development of the portal, Advanced Energy rolled out a solution that would improve communication between the parties. The collaboration between client and supplier was enhanced with message boards, upload and download of documents, and contact information enabled at the supplier level via permissions. New supplier users were granted registration upon approval. The site also highlights enhanced user experience and better CMS functionality with segregated content, communities and document libraries.

In addition, My Insurance Portfolio also sends similar renewal and billing alerts for any non-Allianz policies an account holder adds to their portfolio, delivering a customer service experience truly devoted to user convenience. To help users quickly find relevant information in their future interactions with Allianz, the portal pulls and displays a history of all quotes and applications received and submitted.

It is the 5th largest social protection group in France. It operates in the fields of health, welfare, savings and pension. It is a non-profit making mutual benefit insurance company and equity fund, managed by its own customers. It insures 1.5 million employees, entrepreneurs, professionals, retired people and individuals.The group employs 1,350 people and has approximately thirty sales offices, mainly in the  Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. In 2013, the group allocated 15 million euros to social actions, supporting several projects to promote health prevention, assistance to people with disabilities, professional reinsertion and assistance to the elderly.In order to confront sweeping changes taking place in the social welfare system in  France - focus switching to the marketplace and increased competition - Apicil has chosen  an approach focused on innovative products and services, which are underpinned by a modernized information system.ChallengeFor many years, the Apicil Group owned around 15 different websites that were out of date, not scalable and unable to provide the outstanding level of services they desired. In 2013, during a change of platform, a decision was made to create a single website that would  simplify access to the group\u2019s different services.

This major project also involved a switch to a paperless system for all of the group\u2019s documents  and processes.Decision and added value for the companyIn 2013, Apicil began a call for tenders that involved several software providers. The Liferay solution was chosen and the new portal was created five months later. This flexible tool laid the foundations for Apicil\u2019s new services. The website is now easier for customers to use and holds a wealth of information.In a secure personal space, customers can access a wide range of services, including real-time quote simulations, account details by downloading statements, immediate payment of hospital fees, etc.\u201cNearly 1.5 million paper statements were being sent out each year\u201d, points out Yohann Burgan. With Liferay connected to the Apicil information system we are able to be significantly more cost effective and provide a higher standard of service to our customers. We are able to reimburse invoices uploaded to the portal the very same day\u201d.Insurance brokers, another type of user, can view their customers\u2019 portfolios and make offers directly via a pricing portal, track their commission and automatically manage quotes using a process with electronic signatures and built-in management software.The information system department, on the other hand, appreciates Liferay\u2019s flexibility and the way it can be easily integrated with existing business applications. There are about thirty people engaged in the team with another fifteen people from the core businesses that create the content.  The flexibility and user-friendliness of the solution are greatly appreciated. \u201cThe idea was to give each line of business as much autonomy as possible\u201d, states Yohann Burgan.\u201cEveryone\u2019s a winner. The developers created templates aligned with the Group\u2019s design guidelines and contributors then choose the one that suits their needs and fill-in the content sections.  Every three weeks new functions are put into service. The solution\u2019s agility and performance  are outstanding\u201d.Apicil has also connected Lifaray to the Google Maps application so it can provide geo-localization functions for its health partners.To date, 120,000 users log-on the new website. The objective is to double that number by  next year.  \u201cAn average of 400 accounts are created by customers every day, in total autonomy\u201d, adds Yohann Burgan.In the future, the website will be mobile-friendly. The \u201cResponsive Design\u201d function of Liferay allows the site to be displayed in native mode on tablets and smartphones, and a mobile application for customers will be interfaced with Liferay. \u201cThis is the next major step for us. It is essential to adapt our services to the mobile usage\u201d, adds Yohann Burgan.Another important development is \u201cTargeting\u201d. \u201cWe would like to use content contextualization to fulfil the needs of our business teams and offer customers value-added services that are better suited to their needs, as soon as we have properly identified them\u201d. The services available should increase from 30 to 120 by 2015.Finally, the Apicil Group has been investigating ways to include online chat modules to facilitate  its relationship with customers and prospects, ultimately replacing email channels with  digital channels.\f"},{"filename":"AVMED - EN.pdf","text":"We needed to build on a platform that allowed the  experience to undergo continual enhancement  and improvement, and that\u2019s what we have now.Ana Eberhard, Vice President, Member ExperienceChallenges\u2022 Needed to transform three legacy sites onto one dynamic,  mobile-ready platform\u2022 Lacked the \u201cdigital storefront\u201d necessary for an appealing  user experience\u2022 Bottleneck due to IT involvement for content changes or site updates\u2022 Wanted to refocus on the customer and customer experienceResultsIncreased sIte traffIcOver 20,000 more unique visitors per month from the previous yearreduced costsLess support calls saved almost  $40,000\u2014in just one quartermobIleAgile, adaptable and  mobile-enabledscalableIntegrated for continued enhancement and improvementbusIness user frIendlyMarketing team can now make simple changes without IT involvementSummaryTo improve site design  and become mobile-ready, AvMed used Liferay to  integrate three hard-coded, legacy sites into one, where they created four unique portals for their members.In BriefIndustry:Insurancecountry\/regIon:USA, Floridause case:Customer Portals,  Public Website, Content Management Solutions,  Mobilekey features:WCM, mobile responsiveness,  Liferay Asset Publisher,  Single Sign-On, third-party integrationContactrIvet logIc corporatIon703-955-3480 rivetlogic.comA Customer-Driven Web Redesign Drives Engagement for Health InsurerAvMed delivers modern healthcare experience through personalized,  mobile-friendly and streamlined new site\f2From Legacy Website to Customer CentricFormerly Aviation Medicine, AvMed began in 1969  as a niche healthcare insurance provider for the growing aviation industry in Miami, Florida.  Today, AvMed provides commercial, individual  and Medicare health coverage to more than 380,000 Floridians in over 30 counties throughout the state. Customer service has always been the heart of AvMed\u2019s mission. But with a legacy website that wasn\u2019t yet mobile-ready, AvMed needed to update its IT process and user experience. Using Liferay,  AvMed partnered with Rivet Logic to optimize the  login experience and create an appealing site design.  The new website consolidated three legacy properties  (avmed.org, Medicare and Embrace Better Health) into one homepage. These changes increased digital engagement, encouraged new site traffic and decreased customer support costs\u2014all while leading AvMed to become truly customer-centric.Designing a Digital StorefrontIn order to provide a terrific customer experience, new processes were required. Recognizing that AvMed\u2019s  members wanted a functional mobile experience, they planned for a site redesign to meet the change in  customer needs. AvMed wanted a central, user-friendly  website with portals for each type of user. To bridge the silo between IT and marketing, they needed a  platform with WCM capabilities. Before, any content  update required adjustment to the source code, meaning the marketing department was unable  to edit and publish content themselves. \u201cThe [legacy] website was built from the inside out,\u201d  said Ana Eberhard, AvMed\u2019s Vice President of Member Experience. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t needs-driven.  If you had any content that you needed to change, you needed to get IT involved.\u201dFurther, it lacked what she called a digital storefront, a clear presentation of AvMed\u2019s services and  brand identity. The unappealing design was enough to limit new business and discouraged existing members from engaging with the brand. These pain points illustrate how customer needs encouraged AvMed to invest in new technology.  More than a health insurance provider,  AvMed\u2019s Wellfluent\u2122 brand provides resources  to the public for tips and news on wellness and healthy living. After the site updates, current and  past resources were easier to search and find. AvMed was able to better market their content  and services to interested and invested parties.Scalable Benefits Without IT Involvement Using Liferay, AvMed designed four unique user portals to improve the site\u2019s design and functionality.  Now, logging on to the new site through Single  Sign-on (SSO) asserts that customers are experiencing a much less cumbersome process. Redesigning the journey through the lens of the customer experience meant implementing a phased approach. With an  IT support staff of less than 10, the flexibility of tackling projects separately (i.e., separating the portals)  was essential. \f3\u201cWe appreciated that building [AvMed] on Liferay made it scalable,\u201d Eberhard said. Because of the easy-to-use nature of Liferay,  AvMed and Rivet Logic were able to launch the  first new portal in just a few months, with future plans to modernize the three remaining portals. Because Liferay was designed for integration,  a number of helpful third-party applications were supported on the new site, including a translation engine to provide a Spanish version of the site,  and a web accessibility tool making content screen reader compatible.And by utilizing Liferay\u2019s Asset Publisher, content across the site became easier to use through the use  of categories and tags. With a clean dashboard, relevant information surfaced right away. For instance,  updating personal information could be accomplished  quickly in a snapshot that was easy to find. No longer  did changing content for the marketing team require  IT support, a costly and cumbersome process. From a customer perspective, the new site makes much more sense for the user.Immediate ROIThe results were significant. Site visits (and time spent on the site) increased immediately after the Q4 redesign to more than 20,000 unique visitors per month from the following year. Call center volume dropped, saving AvMed almost $40,000 within one quarter of measurement. But more importantly, the customer experience improved.  A portlet called \u201cShow Me the Math\u201d helped members  understand the cost breakdown per event between  what they paid and what AvMed paid. This transparency  isn\u2019t just a better business practice, the optimized communication has helped decrease costly customer  support calls.Of course, no website is ever finished. But the modular  benefit to using Liferay makes future work easier.  Where the legacy site required maintenance downtime,  the new website is always live with 24x7 uptime.\u201cWe needed to build on a platform that allowed  the experience to undergo continual enhancement and improvement,\u201d Eberhard said, \u201cand that\u2019s what we have now.\u201d\f"},{"filename":"BIK Case Study English Web.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYBIK Biuro Informacji Kredytowej (Credit Information Bureau) collects, processes and  makes available information about bank and credit union customers throughout Poland.  BIK carries out its activity pursuant to the Act of 29 August 1997\u2013Banking Law.  The law stipulates that banks acting jointly with bank chambers of commerce may establish an institution authorized to process and make available information to banks and other institutions statutorily authorized to grant credits and loans. BIK\u2019s prime objective was to build a unique comprehensive database of information about credit and loans for bank and credit union customers.BIK cooperates with 100% of the companies from the banking sector in Poland:\u2022   42 commercial banks\u2022  572 banks from the cooperative banking sector\u2022  55 credit unionsBIK in numbers (as of December 2013):\u2022 270 million credit reports issued since 2001\u2022  22.6 million individuals registered in the BIK database\u2022  120 million registered credit accountsChallengeBIK\u2019s mission is to provide financial institutions, consumers and businesses with information about products and tools that inspire the trust and security of participants in financial activity in Poland.Nevertheless, the image of BIK on the consumer market was quite negative. Consumers did not understand or were not at all aware of the company mission and its role. BIK\u2019s offerings for consumers were limited to a few credit reports which were difficult to understand,  and their availability to the general population was very limited.    Biuro Informacji Kredytowejwww.bik.pl\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDY140904In 2010, after detailed market surveys among consumers, BIK identified precise targets and scope for a new initiative. According to survey results they needed to design a new product portfolio answering the most urgent consumer needs. A new strategy of communication was also outlined in order to provide more accurate and easy to understand guidelines to consumers trying to build up and manage a positive credit history.All that was needed was a platform to build this new business from scratch.ResolutionOnce BIK\u2019s new aims and strategy had been defined, an in-depth analysis of requirements began simultaneously with extensive research for the right technology and implementation provider. In early 2011 this research was completed and, in line with their implementation partner\u2019s recommendations and experience, Liferay Portal was selected as the best possible choice. The flexibility and extensibility of the Liferay platform, along with its ability to provide robust security, services and performance on an enterprise level, proved it was the ideal choice.  It delivered not only a modern information portal, but also a self-service platform for customers with e-commerce and communication services and a number of mission critical applications for the customer service center.Business Value Added The new portal at www.bik.pl was introduced to the public in April 2013. Right from the start it has proved that the underlying business concept and the portal technology had hit the bullseye. The number of customers registered in the system continuously grows and the  new platform allows secure, useful and easy access to data related to customers\u2019 credit history.

Military officials felt poorly represented by the disorganized model which also created huge inefficiencies in communication.The Brazilian Army needed an internal system that ensured confidentiality and security in communication channels. Its former model did not support digital content management, causing officials to rely on analogue media such as print copies. These difficulties in content editing and management resulted in lost productivity. It was clear that the Brazilian Army required a portal that could provide content security and an easy-to-use communication system while transforming the overall layout of the portal.resOlutiOnThe Brazilian Army partnered with system integrator and Liferay partner, Sea Tecnologia  for a portal modernization plan.

The\u00a0company offers a wide range of financial solutions in Life Assurance, General Insurance, Health Insurance, Retirement Planning, Asset Management and Property.In 2012, Britam launched an ambitious IT-enabled business transformation project called Project Jawabu, aimed at achieving aggressive growth in income and profitability across new regions in Africa. To make this vision a reality, Britam needed to build a digital experience platform that would enable them to re-engineer business process and deliver convenient experiences for customers, staff, financial advisors, agents, partners and other stakeholders.Vision for Digital TransformationThe digital transformation at Britam is a combination of changes to IT systems at every level, ranging from the underlying line of business systems, to databases and digital engagement services.The company saw many common obstacles that needed to be overcome in order to truly transform:\u2022 Multiple homegrown systems that were  ill-equipped to share data\u2022 Existing line of business systems couldn\u2019t keep pace with the changing business environment\u2022 Agent broker experience was manual and  time-consuming\u2022 No online integration with Britam partnersAfter assessing several leading portal solutions and\u00a0digital experience platforms, Britam decided on Liferay.

Parts of central London falling under Camden\u2019s jurisdiction, such as Holborn and Covent Garden, are amongst the capital\u2019s most developed areas.Camden Council delivers over 500 services to nearly 250,000 residents and 24,000 businesses, and supports a daily flow of commuters and visitors that increases its population threefold. To ensure utmost quality of service, scrutiny committees carefully measure performance throughout the year. They play an important role in identifying areas that are not successfully meeting standards.ChallengeLocal or central government bodies strive to deliver services as efficiently and effectively  as possible. This is a great challenge \u2013 efficient services may not be able to address  complex issues, and effective services usually are not easily translated into straightforward  online procedures. Previously, Camden provided a limited number of disjointed online services. A lack of cohesion and usability resulted in slow and expensive processes that caused confusion for end users, in many cases requiring multiple contacts at the Council to get one thing done. This situation was represented by a set of siloed ICT systems, reflecting the Council\u2019s disparate service offerings.Camden recognised its services needed to be overhauled into a user-friendly online offering with a single user interface (UI) for end users \u2013 one for citizens and one for local businesses. The resulting savings in operational costs were a significant benefit, with an initial target of \u00a3300,000 in annual savings year on year attached to the business portal project.  The Council\u2019s business objective was to move 85% of their transactions online by 2015 using proven and robust software platforms. At this stage there was no preference for either open source or proprietary software.London Borough of Camdenwww.camden.gov.uk\u201cLiferay is the perfect solution for our agile approach to developing applications. The open standards platform allows us to concentrate on developing a great user experience in the knowledge that we are not locking ourselves into unsustainable support costs.\u201dJohn JaCksonAssistant Director of ICT\fWWW.LIFERAY.COMLIFERAY CASE STUDYResolutionThe Council\u2019s priorities \u2013 service delivery and end user experience \u2013 defined the first step in designing a solution. An in-depth research initiative revealed a variety of requirements expected by Camden\u2019s residents and businesses: a single point of contact, viewable status and history of transactions, customised content, and automated messaging and transaction confirmation. The right solution obviously needed to be flexible and customisable. To lower costs and encourage users away from expensive, traditional channels, any online offering must be a better and more convenient experience. Camden therefore designed their solution \u2018bottom up\u2019 from the end  user experience, using an open source portal solution: easy to set up, customisable, interoperable, and flexible. In summary,  Alasdair Mangham (Head of Information Systems and Development, Camden Council) said, \u201cWe must remember that channel shift  is the Council\u2019s objective \u2013 not the customer\u2019s. For our customers it is always about the easiest way to get something done.\u201dInitial in-house testing demonstrated Liferay Portal\u2019s ability to meet Camden\u2019s requirements in many ways, including multi-level authorisation,  standard compliance, and customisation of the user registration process. Camden\u2019s Assistant Director of ICT, John Jackson, then commissioned a formal evaluation with Gartner, who recognise Liferay Portal as a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals. Their expert analysis  proved to be a deciding factor into executive buy-in.Liferay now powers the user interaction end of Camden\u2019s two portal solutions: a business portal and a citizen-facing portal. Both portals offer single points of contact where businesses and citizens can access information and transact securely with the council. Businesses  and citizens have different needs and frequencies of interaction. Liferay\u2019s flexibility, however, meant that most of the code and functionalities used in one portal could be adapted to the other. Other key components of Liferay included:\u2022 High level of configurability without touching the core of the software\u2022 A wealth of out-of-the-box features\u2022 Standards compliance\u2022 Enterprise grade support and UK-based account management\u2022 Interoperability and integration capabilities (including Facebook, Google and Open ID login; legacy line of business application using Camden\u2019s integrated business services (SOA) and GIS addressing service; and financial information systems)\u2022 Compatibility with the UK Government\u2019s Open Standards agendaFinally, Liferay\u2019s agility allows for extensions of the portals to be taken in stages. From the first installation of Liferay, a working  citizen-facing portal was live in just twelve weeks. Within the following 15 months, Camden will have achieved two further releases on  the citizen-facing portal, and two on the business portal.Business value addedThe ongoing challenge for government continues to be delivering more services for less cost, and Liferay as an open source portal solution enables just that. Camden\u2019s portal solutions reduce costly, traditional channels of service delivery by moving them online in a way that is secure, user-friendly and customisable. With no increase in staffing, Camden\u2019s ICT team have seen increased productivity, faster time to market, and significant savings for the Council.Future planned releases include higher-level services for more sensitive layers of data requiring two-factor user authentication, as well as use of Liferay Portal\u2019s standard auditing portlet to capture relevant data to be fed into the Council\u2019s customer insight and operational management processes. As local and central government evolve to the next phase of web development, moving from delivering simple transactions to a unified online customer service, they will find significant opportunity for innovation and savings offered by Open Standards-based software.Both Liferay and Camden are committed to continue working together to offer a local government solution on Liferay Marketplace in future.  Organisations interested in such a solution are encouraged to contact Liferay.130107\f"},{"filename":"CAPELLA UNIVERSITY CASE STUDY2.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMhttp:\/\/www.capella.eduCapella Universitywww.capella.edu\u201cWe needed a portal product that was reliable, scalable, very flexible, would deliver new fea-tures rapidly, and that included built-in CMS and social media tools. Liferay fit the bill with all of this.\u201d  JaSon SCherSChLigtManager of Online User ExperienceORGANIZATIONCapella University, a leading online university, aims to take online education to a higher level by providing high quality bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, doctoral, and certificate programs for adults who seek to maximize their personal and professional potential. It offers innovative programs that are responsive to the needs of adult learners and involve active, engaging, challenging, and relevant learning experiences offered in a variety of delivery modes. As a widely acknowledged leader in delivering high-quality education over the web, Capella was the first online university to be recognized by The Council for Higher Education Accredita-tion (CHEA) for its work on student learning outcomes CHALLENGEAs an institution that hosts all of its courses online, Capella University is heavily reliant on complex web-based systems that can help students and professors navigate university life. While much of this experience occurs within Capella\u2019s online course rooms, which are powered by the Blackboard learning management system (LMS), students also need access to resources like billing, course selection, and grades. Capella\u2019s portal, iGuide, also provides Capella\u2019s learners with essential support and academic content and tools for managing their academic career. When Capella implemented the PeopleSoft ERP system in 2007, it was able to deliver this portal functionality through PeopleSoft\u2019s built-in tools. While its ERP system is a valuable asset, Capella needed to enhance it with a portal and content management system (CMS) that allowed design flexibility and additional integrations.It was determined that a new portal platform was needed to integrate all of Capella\u2019s technologies for a unified, personal, and intuitive user experience. Capella wanted the ability to create a state-of-the-art web experience instead of a generic portal look and feel. In other words, it was time for a richer user experience that would allow iGuide to become the virtual representation of the university that Capella had originally envisioned.\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMRESOLUTIONCapella decided to enhance the essential core business functionality of the PeopleSoft ERP with a feature-rich, personalized web experience. After drafting some new criteria, Capella engaged a technical consulting firm to perform an unbiased evaluation of various portal technologies. Issues like flexibility, architecture, interface and content, user base vitality, and use (in total, over 40 different high-level criteria) were taken into account.Although Capella considered many portal products, it chose Liferay Portal for its plethora of out-of-the-box features and social networking capabilities. The community and networking tools would help learners build academic and professional networks, as well as their own professional identities. The ability to integrate existing systems was also a key deciding factor, as Liferay\u2019s adherence to open standards allowed it to abe easily integrated with PeopleSoft ERP.Liferay\u2019s open integration capabilities have provided Capella a service-oriented architecture (SOA) layer that helps them access data. The most innovative and popular use of this technology is Capella\u2019s course dashboard, personalized for every learner, which uses web services to display real-time academic activity from the Blackboard course room directly onto the home page of the Liferay portal.They have also implemented group-functionality that allows administrators to create groups for the school. Some are topical, while others are based on programs and interest groups. In addition, Capella was able to leverage Liferay\u2019s dynamic drag-and-drop feature to create the Degree Completion Plan, an interactive online environment that allows academic advisors to customize each learner\u2019s course of study by dragging and dropping courses and other elements in a webpage; it gives students on-demand access to their academic progress. Interactive designers and content managers have also been working to create new expanded user profiles, which would give students and staff their own virtual identities.Today, Capella delivers a full university experience via the web. Learners in every degree program in all five of Capella\u2019s schools are now using the Liferay-based version of iGuide, which equates to nearly 40,000 users plus faculty and staff. The new portal is helping users access resources more easily and supporting them in their academic growth. Capella has also seen over 100,000 friend-relationships develop among their users through the Liferay-based networking tools.Students have voiced their preference of the new site\u2014over 90 percent prefer the Liferay-based portal to the previous one. One student praised, \u201cThe brain trust responsible for coming up with this idea needs to be rewarded. Thanks for thinking  of us! I just wish this was here when I was just starting out.\u201d Another lauded, \u201cOne word: Wow! I really enjoyed using this layout. It is much better than the older version in which everything was scattered about. Being new to online learning, I found this format to be much more user-friendly.\u201dLooking ahead, Capella plans to implement additional features including faculty content and tools, more social media tools, built-in alerts and indicators, mobile versions of iGuide, enhanced tools and content for supporting learners, and enhanced partner pages (Capella\u2019s partners include large corporations for professional extension). As Capella continues to integrate and enhance web experiences for learners and faculty, Liferay will become even more integral to its systems. \u201cLiferay was the right choice to meet our needs,\u201d said Jason Scherschligt, Manager of Online User Experience. \u201cWe needed a portal product that was reliable, scalable, very flexible, would deliver new features rapidly, and that included built-in CMS and social media tools.

In 1989, the Carrefour Card was created in Brazil, with the purpose of offering clients various credit options, shopping funds and other benefits. This meant Carrefour was the only food retailer in Brazil with its own bank. The growth in popularity of the card led to the creation of Carrefour Financial Solutions in May 2007. Currently, the Carrefour Group has more than 200 stores across the country and over 70,000 employees.The ChallengeCarrefour Bank faced the challenge of developing  a new self-service portal for customers. Within this portal, the customer needed to be able to access financial extracts, negotiate debts and credits, and manage other kinds of interactions. The main purpose was to offer more benefits to clients while giving them self-service options that decreased Carrefour\u2019s costs for Customer Support.The old portal could already provide Carrefour Card clients some services through the log in area. However, it was necessary to aim for a long-term multichannel strategy by building out new functionalities with more scalability and independent management.In addition, it was necessary for the marketing and business teams to quickly build new products and content as well as publish them with autonomy, without involving IT.

It is the leading personal insurer in France and the 6th in Europe. CNP Assurances covers 14 million policyholders with life, savings and pension insurance, and 27 million with personal risk and protection policies.  CNP Assurances employs 4,800 people worldwide. For 160 years, CNP Assurances has offered a full  range of savings, pensions and personal risk insurance accommodating the needs of individuals  and constant market changes. Its products are marketed through long-standing partnerships, in particular in France with Caisse d\u2019\u00c9pargne and La Banque Postale.The CNP Assurances Innovation and IS Impact Assessments team was created in 2011 to come under its Programmes and IS Department. The extremely flexible team of four is responsible for responding to the many and various demands of the different business units as well as from the Programmes and IS Department. In order to do so successfully, the team has created, developed or integrated only open-source solutions which are recognized, flexible,  efficient and scalable. During a project\u2019s lifecycle, the team communicates with its internal \u201ccustomers\u201d by suggesting tailored, flexible project management practices. However, it also welcomes customer feedback.It is with this background that CNP Assurances chose Liferay in 2009. A number of projects were considered, including one on the CNP Assurances products and processes knowledge-base.ChallengeThe \u201cKnowledge Base\u201d project presented a number of challenges. First of all, the existing base would have to be remodelled and its content, which had become difficult to manage, reorganized in order to direct the service to policyholders. This base contains approximately 350 insurance \u201cproducts\u201d, 450 management procedures (with combined appendices totalling 14,000)  and 5,000 attached files. All of this adds up to just over 15GB of data.In total, there are 1,500 users who access the base daily and 2,000 occasional users. The second challenge lays in opening up access to CNP Assurances to external players so that they would be able to partially access information in the repository depending on their access rights. CNP Assuranceswww.cnp.frBusiness teams experience the project first-hand with us.Ludovic AndrieuxProject Manager, Innovation  and IS Impact Assessments,  CNP Assurances\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CAsE studY140709There was also another challenge for the Innovation team:  finding an innovative solution that met their flexibility and business efficiency requirements that also had a good cost to deadline ratio. ResolutionThere were several reasons CNP Assurances chose Liferay. The product\u2019s flexibility was one. \u201cBusiness teams experience the project first-hand with us\u201d, said Ludovic Andrieux, Project Manager for Innovation and IS Impact Assessments at CNP Assurances.  \u201cIt was essential that the project was guided by our customers  right from the start. They became \u201cactive participants\u201d in the project.  Using the web portal, they were able to keep up with their changing needs, make improvements during the development phase,  and customize the tool. For our part, we were able to support them thanks to practices that were flexible (cyclical development thanks to a feedback chain) and targeted\u201d, stated Ludovic Andrieux. We built the graphic interface easily, and the simple operational administration meant users could quickly get to grips with it. It was also  easy to tackle other \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d projects using the Liferay Portal.\u201cAs for the Innovation team, they found that, using Liferay, they could use their expertise to ensure accurate and appropriate encryption for customers. This confirmed its credibility with the Innovation team and with the Programmes and IS Department\u201d, noted Fran\u00e7oise Hoyek, Innovation team manager. Lastly, Liferay\u2019s compliance with standards meant it could integrate more  effectively with the existing information system in a secure environment. Implementing the SolutionLiferay Portal allows for subtle management of content depending on the different products of the user groups.Each product has its own dedicated environment that authorized users can access to find all of the relevant information. The Innovation team developed a specific function based on Liferay\u2019s  application platform which allows each user to see who is in charge of a CNP Assurances contract for a given product, area or customer. Furthermore, there is a forum where users can communicate.  It can be accessed in just one click from the different elements of the page consulted on contract components, products or management procedures. \u201cWe haven\u2019t encountered any problems in the implementation phase\u201d, Ludovic Andrieux pointed out.Business Value AddedIt boiled down to two key elements: ease of access and efficiency.Business users were able to access more easily the information they  were looking for. They liked the uncomplicated availability of content.  As for the administrators, they were happy with the way content could be shared and with the fact that they found little disparity between their interfaces and those of business users.\u201cWe are satisfied with Liferay Portal solution\u201d, affirmed Ludovic Andrieux.  \u201cIt allows us to quickly respond to our customers and we know we\u2019re sure to respond to their functional concerns in the time limits we\u2019ve set for ourselves. This means we\u2019ve been able to focus our development efforts on offering user-friendly online services and ensuring user acceptance. In addition, we are completely sold  on the benefits open source brings to CNP Assurances. The extensive  Liferay community allows us to develop products very quickly, which means that we can develop quickly too. We also like being able to share best practices. Furthermore, we rely on a collection of reusable components. Liferay is extremely scalable and can be adapted to projects of any size. Liferay Portal has completed the technological range we offer our customers.In the future we would like to focus on opening up the knowledge base to other internal or external players using Liferay\u2019s secure functions.  We are also considering going mobile with our 6.2 version, which is  out already, and offering mobility solutions as they are now becoming  indispensable for future projects\u201d, concluded Ludovic Andrieux. \f"},{"filename":"CNP Assurances Study Final-Digital.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYCNP Assurances, entreprise du groupe  Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts, est le premier assureur de personnes en France et le sixi\u00e8me en Europe.

Coach has continued to expand its brand in the realm  of modern luxury throughout its more than 1,000 stores worldwide. With its continued expansions and  more employees than ever, Coach needed to build a  consolidated corporate intranet. Previously, employees  could not search for documents, as Coach\u2019s online employee systems were built from various URLs without a consolidated intranet and content was frequently duplicated due to updates, which lead  to confusion and lost time.Coach also needed an improved way to reach  and inform employees whose main connection to store information was through their smartphones and tablets, which were previously unreached by the company\u2019s online capabilities.Coach wanted to provide its employees with the ability to find the information they needed for  both serving customers and answering human resources questions, which led to the company deciding on a portal software. Coach chose Liferay because of its ability to consolidate information, reach employees on all devices, create a personalized dashboard, incorporate numerous features on a single platform and prepare the company for future digital transformation efforts.Using Liferay, Coach created Coachweb, a single sign- on employee intranet that has become a cornerstone  for Coach\u2019s digital ecosystem and the future of how they use technology to support their employees. Connecting Employees to ContentDue to an unconsolidated database of content, Coach employees found difficulty in locating  the correct version of a document they needed,  leading to lost time spent searching online  and confusion regarding out-of-date policies. Through the creation of Coachweb via Liferay, Coach was able to eliminate redundant, duplicate and  incorrect information with an improved search functionality and content management system that vastly reduced the amount of time spent finding and  updating needed documents from minutes to seconds.By providing employees around the world with a  consolidated platform, team members can self-service  their needs and find fast answers to their questions while meeting the needs of in-store customers. Coach\u2019s employees in both stores and offices now use Liferay to find employee news, messages from the CEO, business strategies, earnings reports and HR information. Creating a Digital WorkplaceIn the age of smartphone usage, increasingly fewer store employees are connecting to enterprise portals  through desktop computers. Coach sought to reach employees wherever they were through an easy-to-use  intranet accessible via mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. In doing so, employees could  quickly and easily find the information they need.Coach\u2019s vision for creating a digital workplace  was to make it as easy to use as possible, preventing frustration concerning interactions with work documentation. Through consolidation on Coachweb, employees do not need to move \f3190211from site to site or remember numerous passwords to access important information, removing the burden on the employee.In addition, employees are now able to communicate more directly with headquarters, receiving information on products and providing feedback based on customer actions in stores.Embracing Digital TransformationFollowing success in enterprise intranet implementation, Coach additionally built their  VM Insights site to streamline and improve their visual merchandising in stores worldwide using Liferay. The global fashion company is looking  to continue improving their backend system integration and further digital transformation in  all aspects of their business.Coachweb has allowed the company to decentralize content management and avoid the time-consuming  process of rebuilding their content by simply replicating it online when necessary. When combined  with document consolidation, Coach has been able to be efficient in how they spend their time and money on internal processes.Coach is also planning on creating apps to meet employee needs and develop closer coordination between regions around the world based on their digital platform.\f"},{"filename":"CopperPoint Case Study - Digital.pdf","text":"CopperPoint continues to leverage both  Liferay and Xtivia as key relationship partners as we continue company expansion and  expand our customer and agent services into the future.Nicolas Fanjeau, Information Technology ManagerResultsNew Policy Holder Portal and updated public websitePersonalized online experiences & content targeting based on role (policyholder, agent, employees)Easy-to-use web\/document CMS for non-technical usersResponsive theme\/design for mobile devicesSummaryFormerly SCF Arizona, CopperPoint became a private company in 2013 after serving as the Arizona state compensation fund since 1925.

Starting with a single pizza restaurant in Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1960, Domino\u2019s is now made up of more than 12,100 stores in over 80 markets.As a global brand with over $9.9 billion in global retail sales in 2015, Domino\u2019s Pizza consists of a network of company-owned and franchise-owned stores in the U.S. and Internationally.The Challenge:  Connecting Team Members Across Roles and LocationsThe Domino\u2019s world is made up of many different moving parts \u2013 from corporate team members and franchisees to their delivery experts collectively driving 10 million miles a day. Although this model is great for business, it doesn\u2019t prove to be an easy method for communication.Many times, the corporate team members found gaps in communicating with franchisees and store team members. A coupon update seems simple enough, but communicating that to franchisees that may or may not be checking email, or relying on other communication methods, means the message could get missed.With the help of Liferay, Domino\u2019s first developed a low-cost online operations manual, which then developed into a fully functional intranet that allowed users to have a one-stop-shop for all things Domino\u2019s. News updates, quick links and department-specific home pages were all features of live.dominos.com, their first go at the intranet game.dLive: A Fresh TakeLive.dominos.com was a great starting point for Domino\u2019s. It created a new sense of togetherness along with a shift in culture towards a more tech-driven form of communication. After four years and much feedback from our users, the team decided to give the site a makeover.\u201cOur goal was to take the current live.dominos.com and create a site that allowed more customization and created a more user-specific experience,\u201d said Stacie Barrett, manager of Internal Communications for Domino\u2019s Pizza.Liferay\u2019s easy-to-use platform allowed Domino\u2019s in-house team to create a brand new intranet that was more than a great new look \u2013 it was a brand new way for Domino\u2019s corporate and franchise team members to get a user-specific experience with three separate home pages: Store, Franchisee and Corporate. Each site is designed for the group that it describes, allowing content to be more relevant to each user. Permissions are set to be site specific, allowing Domino\u2019s to share confidential information securely, which is important in the franchise model.The platform also allowed Domino\u2019s in-house team to create new and exciting features to the site \u2013 most recently, a social sharing tool and an option for subscriptions. DPZ social came to life this past summer and now allows all Domino\u2019s corporate and franchise team members to share photos and posts just like they would on Facebook. This is a \f3190227fun and interactive way for store team members, franchisees and corporate team members to interact with each other.A new subscription-based news tool has also launched, which allows users to pick and choose what content they would like to be notified about. Domino\u2019s in-house team worked within the Liferay platform to create categories and permissions to make this type of service possible.These features, along with things like a customizable dashboard, user profile, messaging system and many others have made dLive a great place for user-specific information.The Wrap-UpWith weekly support calls between Liferay and Domino\u2019s in-house team, along with previous work with Xtivia, traffic has increased from 8,000 per week with the previous site, to 20,000 per week with the new dLive.

The Spanish organization, established in 1960, started operating in Brazil in 2001 when it acquired  Editora Moderna. This Brazilian publisher, a leader in the educational book segment for the public  and private school systems, boasts a more than 40-year history of commitment to education in the country. In addition to books aimed at early, elementary and high school education, the group publishes foreign language learning titles and fiction.Editora Moderna\u2019s mission is to find innovative ways to produce, edit and publish material that significantly contributes to improving Brazilian education and giving teachers and students well-rounded educations. Today, its website offers apps, a teachers\u2019 portal and downloadable books. The company invests in research that ensures it creates effective  tools for its audience, a philosophy that is reflected in its slogan: Creating schools with you.A Digital Strategy for True TransformationFor decades, companies believed that technology in and of itself was the solution to modernizing  their businesses, and replicated cookie-cutter models to limited success. As time passed, companies learned that they needed to go beyond technology and rethink their business processes in transformative ways if they wanted to stay competitive in a digital economy.For Editora Moderna, this meant finding new ways to transfer knowledge to students with different learning profiles, while increasing teacher engagement and making technology a fundamental part of the teaching process. The company\u2019s existing platform made it impossible  to reach these targets. It needed to rethink its entire technology model so that it could meet requirements and integrate seamlessly with the current architecture. The challenge was daunting; the company\u2019s planned time-to-market was short and, as a publisher,  it had an extremely large volume of content to manage. On top of this, Moderna had many obstacles to overcome with its current systems, including problems integrating with legacy systems,  a lack of qualified labor to handle proprietary technology, a dearth of developer partners and inadequate support, as well as difficulties updating the platform with new content.Editora Modernaweb.moderna.com.br\/web\/modernaplusIn BriefCliente: Editora Moderna Country:  Brazil Industry Sector:  Education\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY + GM5 CASE STUDYA User-Centric Redesign That Doubled Mobile VisitorsOnce these challenges were mapped, Moderna began to search for the most appropriate tool,  ultimately choosing Liferay as the best fit.

The planning required for this transition was made possible through a strategic alignment between Moderna, GM5 (the official partner) and the Liferay team.The portal, named Moderna Plus, was redesigned with a focus on usability and performance. A new panel, with sections for Favorites and customized content for each user (for example, specific classes and groups per person), has improved engagement. Teachers and students are able to work on their tablets as part of a \u201cGo Mobile\u201d strategy and search is multifaceted, improving results from different educational titles.Today, a partial move to the adopted solution has already been completed on six of the publisher\u2019s sites, including the Moderna Plus collection, and a new website has been developed  for this new scenario. The benefits of switching to Liferay are very clear: page searches are better positioned, site visits are more frequent, and there is a higher number of users. Best of all,  visits to the site from mobile devices have doubled, affirming that Editora Moderna has successfully found a way to serve its teachers and students in a modern way for the digital age.160705Liferay enabled us to implement our mobile strategy, as well as improve the usability and performance of the portal.

Fujitsu offers services and products in the areas of personal computing, advanced microelectronics and telecommunications. They employ over 150,000 employees, with products and services available in over 100 countries. Striving for Better CommunicationOver the years, Fujitsu has successfully grown to become a worldwide entity whose brand is recognizable in storefronts across the globe. As a company determined to succeed in the longer term, Fujitsu believes in the need for continual improvement and evolution, especially in the customer interaction process.Communication was vital in terms of understanding what customers needed and how Fujitsu could better serve them. Without a service channel enabling these conversations, there would be no means of communicating with the end user in an efficient manner.Fujitsu had applied a traditional strategy of funneling customers to interact with service managers and others in customer-facing positions. Communication involved a lot of manual labor, email and paperwork, and other resource-intensive approaches. With the evolution of new technologies, this approach proved to be tedious and inefficient, and attempts to reach other end user organizations were often frustrated. It was clear the process needed an overhaul.The new approach would transform the Fujitsu-customer relationship through digitalization. They needed a centralized online channel in the Nordic region that would enhance user experience and increase efficiency through automation. They wanted to ensure they could provide effective services that span the entire customer journey for hundreds of thousands of end users in various industries and customer organizations.In BriefCompany: Fujitsu Country\/Region:  Nordic  Industry:  IT Services Use Case: Knowledge Management Platform, Intranet, Social CollaborationFujitsuA new platform improves companywide knowledge management and customer interaction.www.fujitsu.com\/fi\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYDelivering a Real Automated Service ChannelAfter evaluating several options, Fujitsu chose Liferay for their business solution in the Nordic region. With a highly scalable, flexible solution and an open source approach, Liferay proved to be the best value on the market. Liferay also offered the right technology experts to advise on how to implement the service channel. Fujitsu developed a centralized service platform that enhanced the overall user experience and increased efficiency through automation. The platform easily enables non-technical users within the organization to create and publish content. The site is also optimized for both PC and mobile viewing. Furthermore, they were able to reduce maintenance costs and save time from tedious processes and services. \u201cAs a platform, Liferay has helped centralize things in one place and solve both process and user experience issues at the same time,\u201d said Riku \u00d6sterlund, Development Manager, Fujitsu.In order to improve their knowledge and understanding of Liferay, a team of Fujitsu\u2019s developers attended Liferay Training.

Internal end users were very satisfied using an automated service channel and laying to rest some outdated practices within their departments. The new site has also given them a refreshing new user experience, with architecture that enables meaningful user interaction and provides new functions that increase efficiency.Fujitsu needed to develop a state-of-the-art service channel for customers and to take conversations with them to the next level. Liferay has provided a building block in aligning Fujitsu\u2019s technology with their business goals, and early customer feedback has confirmed that Fujitsu is indeed on the right track.160229With Liferay, we are able to offer a real single point of contact for customers with all automation capabilities while reducing our costs.Riku \u00d6sterlundDevelopment Manager, FujitsuThe Liferay DifferenceFujitsu has achieved:\u2022 Centralized platform for customer communications\u2022 Cleaner, more effective user interface for a better user experience\u2022 Digitized methods of interaction between end users\u2022 Internal corporate shift in adopting new technologyWe\u2019re able to support a great variety of organizations and end users, and in the end it\u2019s still the same rock-solid technology platform that is running the whole show.Tommi RinnemaaDirector of Offerings and Presales, Fujitsu\f"},{"filename":"EDUCAMADRID CASE STUDY2.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMhttp:\/\/www.educa.madrid.orgEducaMadridwww.educa.madrid.orgEducaMadrid represents the Madrid, Spain school system, which accounts for over 500,000 students across 1,600 schools.

The bank is a pioneer among traditional banks in India when it comes to using technology to manage its operations. Federal Bank was also among the first banks in India to computerize its branches. Today, the bank offers its customers a variety of services such as internet banking, mobile banking, online bill payment, online fee collection, depository services, cash management services, merchant banking services, insurance, mutual fund products, and much more, as part of its strategy to position itself as a financial super market and to provide its customers the best-in-class experience.Customer Experiences Hindered by LegacyA major roadblock to providing customers with the best customer experience possible was the custom-built legacy website based on dated .net technology. The old website was mainly informative, lacking even the basic actionable features needed by a bank, such as loan applications, opening an account, and call back request. Even basic changes to the content and layout needed exhaustive alterations  to the code and in-depth knowledge of HTML. There was no support available for running dynamic campaigns to drive brand awareness  and generate leads. Further, there were major issues with website stability, as the site often  went down with the slightest increase in load.New Modern Website Places Bank Ahead of CompetitorsWhen the vendor responsible for maintaining the legacy website closed shop, Federal Bank realized that it was time to look for better and future-proof options. After considering multiple options, some of which were already being used at the bank, Liferay was chosen based on its ranking as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals, and a strong recommendation from the consultant supporting Federal Bank with vendor selection. Although the bank was wary of using open-source-based technology considering the industry they operate in, these fears were allayed by the portal\u2019s adherence to strictest security norms, and its ability to be customized and integrated with an array of third-party systems.Liferay supported Federal Bank in identifying  and implementing all key functionalities needed  in a modern banking website. Liferay also  helped in migrating all relevant content from the legacy platform. Custom templates were created for the bank which could later be used to manage content using simple drag-and-drop. The website was also integrated with other internal systems including the CRM and the customer-service portal.  Post implementation, Liferay helped the bank understand the portal, and the possibilities that come with it, in detail. The association has helped the bank in providing new features to its customers on a yearly basis, and to stay ahead of the competition.Gaining New Customer InsightsThe most immediate impact of migrating to Liferay was the freeing up of IT and development bandwidth to focus on more strategic initiatives. As Sooraj Bhat, Senior Manager Digital at Federal Bank puts it, \u201cWe realized how much we could achieve with so little development efforts.\u201d The custom templates made website authoring and content management faster and more efficient. Mobile support meant that the website could be updated from anywhere, anytime, in a hassle-free way. The multi-server architecture also helped in boosting the website stability,  \f3190322and significantly reducing the maintenance hassles. The website availability is 99.9% (against a target of 99.5%).The bank was also able to host all dynamic campaigns on the website, turning it into a powerful business tool for generating business and capturing precious customer insights through integration with their analytics platform. The portal\u2019s personalization capabilities and its support for quick SEO and meta tag management also enabled the bank to push the most relevant offers to its various customer segments. Use of features such as calendar and blogs, quick SEO capabilities and meta tag management has resulted in a significant uptick in the daily number of hits and the time spent on the website. The bank has since had to upgrade the infrastructure to support the increased number of users.The Way ForwardFederal Bank is now planning to upgrade to the latest version of Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP) to provide its customers an even better experience.  Presently, the bank uses social media for amplifying the content on the website. With Liferay DXP,  the bank would be able to leverage social logins and capture deeper insights about their customers.

Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, Genworth traces its roots back to 1871. They have been leveraging Liferay technology for their past two intranet iterations and now looked again to Liferay to reinvent their intranet.Modernizing an Intranet SolutionGenworth\u2019s strength is its employees. They understand the issues families face such as homeownership, aging and caregiving because they face them, too.  In order to better support their workforce, Genworth built the third generation of their intranet using Liferay. This improved solution not only has self-service functionality with a modern look and feel, but also solves many of the problems with Genworth\u2019s pre-existing intranet. Previously, the intranet was described as a static newsletter, not much would get changed or updated. Additionally, it was very time consuming to even publish updates. A more contemporary and user-friendly tool was needed. The intranet now has between 700 to 800 sites; some are intranet-focused, some community-driven and some aim to provide customer service.

Grants.gov also liked that Liferay was secure, affordable and fit a modular architecture approach, which allowed the agency to build a hybrid platform with options of third-party plugins, custom coding and Liferay applications that integrated together.Turning 17 Legacy Solutions  Into a Single User PlatformThe team at Grants.gov aimed to make Liferay the standard architecture for the site as they integrated 17 legacy solutions in a single user platform. Grants.gov took a templated approach  to the information architecture. This allowed them to look holistically at Grants.gov and create a roadmap for bringing modules under the Liferay umbrella. They used Liferay templates to test new pages with global partners in order to ensure they were creating the most effective solution.A key goal throughout the process was to enhance the user experience for everyone who interacted with Grants.gov. For business users, this meant using Liferay\u2019s out of the box content management system to maintain documents and web pages. Employees used to hire professional services whenever an update or change needed to be made. This new system gave  them the flexibility to update content as they saw fit, as well as providing enormous cost savings in licensing fees and labor.Grants.gov was able to use the new platform to create a custom interface for partners that apply for large numbers of grants, such as universities that have a large amount of government programs. These end users are now able to apply without ever going to the Grants.gov website. The team also created microsites and communities of interest in order to bring  parties together and enable collaboration. Many funding opportunities require the collaboration of multiple agencies. The new platform made it easier to work within Grants.gov throughout the application process because of built-in capabilities  for blogs, document management and discussion boards.New Search Increased Usage by 98%One of the largest challenges the team faced was redesigning the search experience. Search is the bread and butter of Grants.gov. They have to make it easy for people to find relevant funding opportunities from over 1,000 program options. The team at Grants.gov researched effective search experiences extensively while developing the plan, and the work paid off. The site went  from a simple search method to a federated search with a Liferay  and Solr implementation. People no longer have to know what they\u2019re applying for in order to find it; they can be directed to the  right grant programs as they click through the filters, and results  update in real time. After the new implementation with Liferay and Solr, Grants.gov saw search usage increase by 98%.An Enhanced User Experience  in Only Six MonthsThe new, modern website design has enhanced the user experience all around. As they updated the site, the team looked  through every single web page and developed a roadmap that  accounts for future enhancement plans. Once the requirements were determined, the development cycle of the entire site took six months from start to finish. The new site experience caused web traffic to jump, making Grants.gov the fourth most visited site in the government space.160913\f"},{"filename":"HaitiOne Case Study - Web.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY + XTIVIA CASE STUDYFaith in ActionMission of Hope, Haiti is a Christian nonprofit working to serve the nation of Haiti and see lives changed. HaitiOne is an initiative started by Mission of Hope to unite the various mission-minded NGOs operating throughout the country with a belief that a strong network and better collaboration can ultimately impact every man, woman and child in Haiti.  HaitiOne\u2019s resolutions recognize that every child needs quality education, a loving home  and an advocate for justice, and all people in Haiti need the opportunity to see, hear and feel the Gospel, experience a dignified means of livelihood, and have access to clean water, proper nutrition, quality healthcare and health education. The HaitiOne network also wants to aid in development of a system for early warnings for disasters and better-organized  relief efforts. Utilizing its network of mission minded NGOs, HaitiOne\u2019s goal is ultimately to help link the organizations serving in Haiti so that, by working together, we can see the nation of Haiti transformed.Connecting a Fragmented NetworkThere are many great mission-minded businesses and NGOs working all across Haiti,  but operating within their own unique sphere of influence with minimal collaboration  even though they face the same types of challenges. The HaitiOne Network began with  a series of meetings and conferences designed to connect these organizations. And from  the first gathering, it was clear that there was a need and huge opportunity to connect together to share ideas, best practices, and encourage one another. And with so many organizations scattered throughout the country, it became clear that leveraging the developing Internet infrastructure within Haiti would be a great way to stay connected between meetings.With all this in mind, the idea for a digital application called HaitiOne.org to support the HaitiOne Network was born. This application would help each organization publish HaitiOne www.haitione.orgIn BriefCompany: Mission of Hope, Haiti Country\/Region:  Haiti  Industry:  Nonprofit Use Case:  Collaboration Platform, Public WebsiteWe would never have been able to launch on time on our budget if Liferay hadn\u2019t had so much out of the box.Scott CampbellBusiness OperationsHaitiOne\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY + XTIVIA CASE STUDYinformation about where they worked and what services they offered. In addition, HaitiOne members could provide updates on what God was doing through their organization and share knowledge on the best ways to run different programs like education, orphan care, medical clinics, pastoral training, agriculture and more. Finally, the HaitiOne partners believed the application would become a great vehicle to show the outside world the cumulative impact of their work on the nation. With all this in mind, a multi-year roadmap of features and functions was created.Looking for a Trusted Feature-Rich PlatformWith the need and vision for the HaitiOne Network taking shape,  it became time to investigate the right technology and partner to  build the solution. While the planned scope of the initial releases was kept small, the need to scale the application and add features seamlessly over time was a critical requirement. Because Mission of Hope and most of the other HaitiOne members are nonprofits,  the need to steward resources well and keep costs low was also vital.  After an extensive evaluation of products on the market, Mission of Hope chose Liferay, a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals, as the software platform of choice due to its many out-of-the-box (OOTB) features, built-in web content management system, low TCO and long-term flexibility. Next came the need to choose a development partner to build the initial release. Mission of Hope selected XTIVIA (winner of Liferay\u2019s Partner of the Year award for three years and a leader in the portal space). According to Scott Campbell, Business Operations Team Lead at Mission of Hope, \u201cThe fit with XTIVIA was outstanding. From the very first meeting we knew they could be a great partner because they invested a lot of time trying to really understand our needs and then helped carefully map our ideas into Liferay\u2019s capabilities while keeping project schedules and budgets in mind.\u201d With Liferay\u2019s broad feature set and XTIVIA\u2019s experience with building on the platform, the new HaitiOne.org site went live in October 2014 taking less than five months to launch.An Online Network for Real-World  Impact in HaitiThe HaitiOne.org team worked with XTIVIA to build both a  public-facing website and an internal network for member collaboration.  Each organization that joins HaitiOne can publish a profile explaining who it is, where it operates, what services it offers, and the impact it is having across different measurable dimensions. There are also filtering features allowing users to find organizations that match certain geographies or other areas of interest such as orphan care or education, which benefits both HaitiOne members as well as those outside Haiti looking for places to get involved. Using Liferay\u2019s CMS capabilities and social functions, a section for posting current needs and sharing past experiences in Haiti has been brought online. Now, members can enroll and participate in message boards, check for news updates and network on the HaitiOne website. Over time each topic will evolve into a full-fledged resource center containing documents, best practices, resource links in addition to collaborative discussions. The team is already at work adding features like Facebook integration, geo mapping, and more to provide additional value for HaitiOne members. \u201cThe number one thing is how easy it is for our team to add content and basic features. We don\u2019t need developers to maintain the majority of the site and can freely add information ourselves with Liferay,\u201d said Campbell. \u201cWe would never have been able to launch on time on our budget if Liferay hadn\u2019t had so much out of the box and XTIVIA not helped us make wise architecture choices on how to use it.\u201d The Road AheadThanks to Liferay and XTIVIA, HaitiOne has taken its first steps toward building a deeply impactful online network. Organizations are starting to discover and coordinate with other HaitiOne partners before taking on new projects so they can learn about pitfalls and opportunities from those who have been through it before. And with the initial release of  HaitiOne.org in place, Mission of Hope can start to invite more organizations  into the HaitiOne Network as well as offer them a place to share their expertise and impact. \u201cGod has given Haiti everything it needs to see lives transformed,\u201d said Brad Johnson, President of Mission of Hope. \u201cAnd as the organizations serving in Haiti have better tools to work together, we can see the dream of reaching every man, woman and child become a reality.  We appreciate XTIVIA consistently going the extra mile to find creative solutions to deliver the first release of HaitiOne.org, and we look forward to collaborating with them on future phases.\u201dAs for XTIVIA\u2019s staff, the payoff from this project has been much bigger than just the satisfaction of a successful client solution delivered.  The team loves to work on HaitiOne.org for the organizations working there and ultimately for the people of Haiti.The Liferay DifferenceThe HaitiOne program experienced:\u2022 A site launch in just 5 months\u2022 Easy-to-use web\/document CMS for non-technical users\u2022 Greater unity between NGOs with new digital network\u2022 Enhanced collaboration with social features (forums, blogs, user groups)150728\f"},{"filename":"HANSEMERKUR CASE STUDY2.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMhttp:\/\/www.hansemerkur.deHanseMerkurwww.hansemerkur.deHanseMerkur is a Hamburg-based insurance group with more than 130 years of experience in private health insurance, its main business segment.

As a strategic player on the energy market, GRDF acts neutrally to assist suppliers, subsidiary partners, local communities and customers.With 11,500 employees, GRDF performs its public service missions daily by managing the downstream gas network, connecting and delivering gas to around 11 million customers, thanks to the 196,940 kilometer network of natural gas pipelines, the largest natural gas network in Europe. GRDF designs, builds, operates, and maintains this grid in more than 9,500 cities while guaranteeing safety of people and property, as well as quality of delivery.ChallengePreviously, a range of small websites was designed regionally without any real graphical or technical continuity. Calls for tenders imposed significant requirements in terms of budget and lost time, for results that were ultimately disparate, with little value created. For national websites connected to internal GRDF information systems, the ambition to respond more rapidly to new requirements or developments required a paradigm shift.As a result, a decision was made in 2013 to acquire a complete digital experience platform to manage all of the web channels. \u201cThe objective for this \u2018Factory as a Service\u2019 was to offer business teams an out of the box solution and agile methodology to support the creation of new websites and the redesign of existing websites,\u201d relates Franck Biet, Communication and Collaboration Manager.This required the creation of an infrastructure platform with cross-functional services, as well as the choice of a single service provider to facilitate dialogue. SOFIT (SOcle Fonctionnel Internet et Technique - internet and technical operating platform) was therefore created internally to centralize the design and maintenance of all GRDF websites. GRDFModern and mobile websites, offering genuine customer experienceswww.grdf.frGRDF has acquired a complete digital experience platform for managing all of its web channels. With this \u201cFactory as a Service\u201d,  we are providing our business teams with an out of the box  solution and agile methodology for designing modern, mobile websites with significant added value.Franck BietCommunication & Collaboration Manager\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CAsE studY151222\u201cBy choosing a single service provider, establishing SLAs, an agile methodology and a private Cloud for hosting, SOFIT has provided itself with the resources for designing easy to use websites,  offering a genuine customer experience and adapted to mobile use,\u201d Franck Biet explains.DecisionLiferay was chosen according to a number of criteria to redesign the www.grdf.fr website and to create a web factory.\u201cWe wanted a modern portal that\u2019s flexible and adapted to mobile use. With the gradual integration of Gazpar smart meter, it also had to be reliable and scalable to reach a target of 11 million users,\u201d Franck Biet continues. From a financial point of view, the team was looking for a reasonable solution with a controlled model for growth in the number of licenses.  \u201cIt\u2019s important, particularly for communication campaigns where it might be necessary to establish additional servers as a temporary measure,\u201d Franck Biet indicates.Finally, Liferay was appealing for its strong user community. It is a proven solution on  the marketplace, supported by IT developers and architects. Business Added ValueWith its new digital experience platform, GRDF now offers websites that meet customer needs whilst maintaining technological and graphical uniformity. SOFIT has successfully completed over 15 different projects over the past two years. For example, these two flagship projects:RapiD\u2019SiteSFirst SOFIT\u2019s project, this web factory allows business teams to create event websites in line with the GRDF design guidelines. Using on-demand \u201cworkflow\u201d, the user completes a form,  selects the desired template from a catalogue and monitors their order progress online.  \u201cOur users are very satisfied with this solution especially now that creating new websites is  very quick. Each request moves from request initiated to undergoing personalization in just  24 hours. Then the live stage follows rapidly,\u201d specifies Franck Biet. The simplicity of the back-office has also played a major part in the success of the tool. The user is free to modify content to their liking without any training required. Over 200 sites have currently been created.GRDF.FRThe website previously recorded a drop-out rate of 43% from the home page. The user needed to know exactly what they were looking for in order to find it. Business teams made little contribution to editorial content, which was organized in a compartmentalized and  hierarchical fashion. \u201cFor the redesign, we have involved the business teams as well as an ergonomist and a web designer. We wanted to establish relevant customer experiences to attract and retain customers,\u201d Franck Biet specifies.The new website is launched only four months after and attracted 140% more visitors compared to 2014. The solution\u2019s native features offer more extensive business services that are easier to use.  \u201cFor example, an existing gas customer can check their meter online or request a safety assessment. If they are not currently using gas, they can request a connection. The services can also be adapted to very specific needs. The customer can view advice on how to choose an economical heating system and plan their renovation project budget or get information about regulations for a construction project,\u201d Franck Biet concludes.The contact-us section was also improved and led to a significant increase in incoming contact requests.Tomorrow, the team would like to implement a search engine for all GRDF websites.

The MRB Interchange, as the new platform is known, has now become a common area to track and find organizational knowledge and products created by the market research teams. It also serves as a vital tool of reference in new research. In addition, the platform has paved the way for growth within and outside the organization. Users of the new KM system have not only uploaded market research reports and proposals,  but also training documents, papers and articles, industry and company data. This effort has made the repository very rich in diverse knowledge and a vital tool of reference in new research. Combining the efforts of InfoAxon\u2019s development team, IMRB International\u2019s new KM platform now connects a greater number of knowledge experts and market researchers with quality information in shorter periods of time. The collaboration between InfoAxon and IMRB was excellent.

The INEP\u2019s portal was entirely developed in HTML and there lacked a content migration tool. Press and web professionals were forced to assign content updating and maintenance to infrastructure professionals. Due to the lack of a migration tool, all editing had to be performed manually by the press and further adjustments were done by the Infra. In addition, the period of enrollment accessibility threatened the stability of the sit during the peak of the load.resOlutiOnTo address these problems, the ENEM required a portal that provided ease in administration in its straightforward approach to content management. HTML structure was abandoned and all website content was moved to Liferay, which facilitated the work of the press without requiring further help of infrastructure professionals for content management. Liferay was also able to securely support the overload of enrollments for the ENEM.  To further maximize efficiency, an information architecture was implemented by SEA  to modernize the portal and offer greater functionality and accessibility to ENEM.

ISAC chose the Liferay platform to eliminate silos and aggregate student data for streamlined reporting and greater  visibility of data for all business units.studentportal.isac.org\/web\/ guest\/student\/In BriefIndustry: Government (Local\/State)Country\/Region: United StatesUse Case: Employee Portal, Extranet,  Student PortalKey Features: Single Sign On, Unified Data Management, Collaboration, Web Content Management\fwww.liferay.comMaking College Affordable for  Illinois StudentsIn 1957, state lawmakers created the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) to ensure that financial considerations did not prevent Illinois students from realizing their postsecondary educational goals. Today, ISAC has two main priorities: Make college accessible and affordable for Illinois students, and increase the proportion of adults with a postsecondary credential to 60% by 2025. User-centric services are key to ISAC\u2019s vision, whether they\u2019re designing processes for students and families, the 140 colleges and universities it partners with, or its own internal business users. \u201cWe had an existing system, but it was very siloed,\u201d said Kalaiselvan Sambasivan, Application Development Manager. Authentication, authorization and business logic were spread out and  repeated across core applications. This resulted in increased complexity  for the business process, a poor customer experience for ISAC\u2019s partners  and a high maintenance cost.ISAC decided to re-engineer the Gift Assistance Program (GAP)  Access Portal so that its business users and partners could easily see data and track the status of financial aid processes. In order to move  all processes off of the old technology in a cost-efficient way, it needed  a solution that was robust, scalable and reliable, with tools to cater to multiple audiences, manage complicated data systems and reduce the dependency of business users on IT. It was imperative that the solution be flexible, as new regulatory mandates required ISAC\u2019s IT  team to quickly modify programming within strict timelines. Developing a Unified Solution to  Aggregate Student Data and  Streamline ReportingBased on a Gartner report, ISAC chose Liferay as an open source solution that satisfied all functionality, scalability, reliability and total  cost of ownership requirements. With Liferay, ISAC was able to consolidate  all of its student and partner data in GAP Access so that its business users could easily view or run reports in real time. The flexibility of the  platform also meant that business users could request changes with the confidence that the IT team would be able to deliver within their timeframe 98% of the time. The new solution provides visibility into the data for all business units (where it was previously limited to program services and compliance), including accounting and the college outreach team. Now every department can see and run its own reports without going through the IT team. In addition, ISAC manages an annual budget submission review from the 140 colleges and universities with which it partners. The agency used Liferay to digitize the process, changing it from a series of paper-based  steps to a completely digital solution. Instead of tracking mailed applications and reviewing hand-written submissions, ISAC can now view the most current versions of budget submissions online through GAP Access. Partners are also free to change their information as needed,  for instance if demographics change or a new campus needs to be added.One unanticipated benefit that ISAC found after switching to Liferay  was a simplified process for securely transmitting sensitive student data.  Schools used to spend hours encrypting data and transmitting it across  multiple systems in order to update student information. With all of the  data integrated into GAP Access, schools can now view everything in one spot. They can also track students and filter them based on specific criteria. All of ISAC\u2019s programs are visible in one portal as well, available through a single sign in, whereas sites for each program used to be far flung and require users to log in multiple times.When it expanded its use of Liferay to its student portal, ISAC made  it possible to maintain consistent experiences for students. Once students  make an account, they can pick up where they left off with filling out financial aid worksheets, comparing schools or other activities. The portal  also features interactive games and a modern, mobile-friendly design to better appeal to students.Building a Platform for  Future CollaborationHaving a unified platform empowers ISAC\u2019s business users to administer processes without involving IT. They are able to confidently meet deadlines for new requirements, which they couldn\u2019t do easily with the previous system. This has freed IT to support other Illinois agencies and pursue a new collaborative effort with the Illinois Department of Employment Security, Illinois State University and the Illinois Board of Higher Education. ISAC is providing the data for the collaborative team to look at trends for graduation rates and job expectancy rates  for its students. They want to answer questions such as, When a student  goes into a particular program, what kind of growth can she expect to see? The hope is that, down the road, this project will provide even more benefits for Illinois students.\u201cGAP Access will give partners access to every program ISAC has to offer,\u201d  said David Perry, Assistant Director of Partner and Product Services. Liferay has provided a platform for IT and business to work hand in hand as ISAC continues its digital transformation for the benefit of students across the state.160802\f"},{"filename":"LEXMARK Case Study Final-Digital.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYServing an international audienceLexmark International, Inc. provides companies all over the world with printing and imaging products, software, solutions and services with the goal of helping customers to print less and save more.

LGT\u2019s goal was to make all current and future banking services available on mobile devices anywhere, anytime. In addition to customer services,  LGT also wanted to create an employee portal that gave access to customized information and company services. Based on a preliminary project study and a detailed implementation program, LGT SmartBanking was carefully designed to replace the current eBanking solution. LGT thus reinvented its international digital service offering to provide quicker, better and more personal  customer experience. FLEXIBLE RESPONSE TO CHANGING CUSTOMER DEMANDSLGT SmartBanking was an important component of LGT\u2019s digital strategy, so special attention was paid to researching customer needs during the planning phase. Flexibility was especially important, since the initiative was part of a long-term eBanking strategy that will require future development. The new portal software needed to integrate with legacy systems and third-party systems, while keeping to the scheduled timeline. Another important factor was the ability to integrate the system with the existing IT landscape as well as with third-party systems. To evaluate the requirements and make the final decision, stakeholders from asset management, consulting and sales were involved throughout the process. The team selected the Avaloq Front Platform (AFP), which includes Liferay as the central portal, for the LGT SmartBanking solution.OUTSTANDING QUALITY FROM STRATEGIC USER FEEDBACKFollowing the successful completion of the pilot phase, the international rollout began in autumn 2015 and will be implemented in stages through 2017. A team of stakeholders will gather feedback as they interact with customers. This feedback from customers and other users will be applied in each stage of the project roll out, ensuring constant improvement and agile development.

It ensures the undisturbed operation and further extension of the electricity market and access on equal terms for system users.ChALLEngEMavir looked to renew their existing corporate web page. They wanted a modern, flexible, and customizable portal solution that could also be applicable for future developments and a potential future intranet. Mavir\u2019s previous portal could not fulfill these needs.The primary goal was to create an easy-to-use portal that features separate roles for content editors and reviewers by pages, and provides the ability to work with existing systems in their infrastructure. Since the most important functions of the extranet are communication and sharing of valuable and relevant information to visitors, it was imperative that portal operation was fast and effective.RESOLUTIOnIn order to find the best suitable solution, Mavir invited several reputable companies to its closed-door tendering process. Webtown, Liferay Hungary Ltd\u2019s first service partner, eventually won the tender. The company proved to be trustworthy as it was solely responsible for managing the development and installation process. \u201cLiferay is our front-end development platform for the future.\u201dLajos GaraiApplication Operator\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMDuring the pilot project, Webtown demonstrated opportunities in Liferay that eventually convinced Mavir to make the switch. These benefits included standards compliance, easy integration with other systems, broad functionality, and easy-to-use user interfaces. In addition, Mavir was impressed with the diversity of Liferay\u2019s standard box tools as demonstrated by collaboration features, calendar, and webform. As the liberalization of the Hungarian electric market generated a need for information from the vendor\u2019s side, Webtown developed Liferay portlets that visualized huge amounts of real-time and static data needed for daily trading operations. These graphs displayed the current accurate system load, statistic-based predictions, and import-export data all based on xml responses from the \u201cSpectrum\u201d system. However, the main features that were used during the project were CMS and staging. The staging system had to be rewritten at the core level to handle editors and reviewers who only had access to some of the pages, according to LDAP user groups. The editing rights are now limited according to user levels and groups upon signing in. Webtown had implemented the page level and menu level entitlement for the process of editing and approving links with SSO from Novell eDirectory. Webtown has also developed a CMS hook that implements extend-collapse functionality to fulfill the special needs of Mavir. Liferay Portal satisfied all of Mavir\u2019s expectations as the system is performing well, and Mavir wishes to continue the project long-term with the help of Webtown.061411\f"},{"filename":"May Fair Case Study.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMThe May Fair Hotel is the 5-star flagship property of the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel group. In the heart of London, the hotel boasts over 400 luxury bedrooms,        a health spa, a private cinema and exceptional fine dining. The May Fair has a prestigious history and was first opened by King George V in 1927. Today it combines boutique attention to detail with grand hotel service, and enjoys partnerships with important cultural events such as London Fashion Week and the BFI London Film Festival.CHALLENGEAs the group\u2019s flagship property, The May Fair is unique in its exclusivity and standard of luxury. Following a recent \u00a3100 million renovation, the hotel needed to reestablish its brand both physically and virtually. The hotel required a fresh new website with a sophisticated look and feel which set it apart from other hotels and created an inviting overall online experience for the guest.The hotel\u2019s original website was unimaginative and lacked key functionalities.              The May Fair needed a solution that integrated essential e-commerce functions for accommodation and restaurant bookings, microsites for the spa and conference facilities and more. In addition, the previous website was operated remotely by an overseas team. Modifying the site or implementing new features were long and drawn out processes that hindered the hotel\u2019s business agility \u2013 one change to the website could take several months to implement. A complete overhaul of the website, its functionalities and look and feel was required.SOLUTIONLiferay was chosen because it could deliver an exceptional look and feel, as well as all the essential functionalities. Room bookings were integrated with the central reservations system, private pages could be created for exclusive guests or special events, and an analytics system was introduced. Further integrations with Apache,    The May Fairwww.themayfairhotel.co.ukhttp:\/\/www.themayfairhotel.co.uk\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a constant increase in visitor numbers over the last few years\u2026 That translates into millions of pounds of revenue through the May Fair website which runs on Liferay.\u201dIype AbrAhAM Commercial Development Director\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMSSL for bookings and transactions, single sign-on and multivariate testing features were also implemented to create a high-value business solution. Together, all these capabilities created a seamless, personalised experience that made guests feel welcome and want to return to the website and to the hotel itself. The May Fair in turn was able to cultivate valuable relationships with its guests, analyse return visits and user behaviour, and deliver a highly customised experience.As an open source technology, Liferay offered the freedom to build a solution around the guests\u2019 needs \u2013 the central tenet to the hospitality industry. Having previously been locked into a high-cost proprietary solution, the team building The May Fair site welcomed Liferay\u2019s lightweight platform and used it to create an agile solution that could be customised further as needed. The result is a unique online experience that reflects the ethos and character of The May Fair, with an agility that means changes to content, layout and integration now happen within days rather than months. Liferay\u2019s product maturity,  its wealth of out-of-the-box features, and the health of its open source community assured Radisson that it was the right choice.BUSINESS VALUE ADDEDThe new website now gives The May Fair the dynamic web presence such a unique hotel requires. Messaging can be tailored for the visitor, particularly for returning guests, and the content is kept fresh so that visitors return to the website again and again. Since implementing Liferay, the number of new and returning online visitors has grown, along with revenue through online reservations. The May Fair site is now an attractive and enjoyable journey for the visitor, and the ability to deliver a great web experience increases loyalty to the brand and, ultimately, drives business revenue.Liferay\u2019s usability has also benefitted the hotel group by increasing employee productivity and collaboration. Every Radisson Blu Edwardian employee logs in each day through the Liferay platform to get information and to collaborate with their fellow employees. Business units also use Liferay to communicate externally. The platform\u2019s usability and its use of permissioning and roles empower the ordinary business user with the ability to manage the site without depending heavily on the e-commerce team.There are now seven different sites in the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel group built on Liferay, including a mobile site for The May Fair. The potential for further innovation is vast, and the group anticipates major developments in the near future \u2013 including a new property development in Leicester Square. Like the May Fair, this is likely to require its own branding exercise, and creative new concepts are also being explored for the hotels\u2019 food and beverage segments. Liferay\u2019s agility and scalability are making these developments possible, and the knowledge accumulated will continue to be embedded throughout all aspects of the business and exploited as much as possible, multiplying the value of their investment in Liferay.131031KEY SUCCESSES\u2022\tThe May Fair Hotel is Radisson Blu Edwardian\u2019s 5-star flagship hotel with over 400 bedrooms, a health spa, a private cinema and fine dining.\u2022\tLiferay powers the May Fair website which generates millions of pounds of revenue annually.\u2022\tRadisson Blu Edwardian also uses Liferay for six other luxury hotel websites as well as its corporate intranet.\f"},{"filename":"MedImpact Case Study.pdf","text":"\u201cThe solutions built on Liferay improved business agility and reduced ongoing operational costs of ramping up new  client sites.

They chose Liferay to provide a new portal platform, which integrated with existing systems and improved development, information access and content management. As a result, MedImpact is migrating all of its web portal technology to Liferay.medimpact.comIn Briefindustry:Pharmaceuticalcountry\/region:United Statesuse case:Employee Portalkey features:Integration Platform, Single Sign-On, Data Synchronization, Custom Portlets, Custom Theme Styling, Dynamic Web Content\f2Supporting Millions of Benefits MembersMedImpact HealthCare Systems, Inc., is the nation\u2019s largest full-service pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)  deriving revenue through independent drug benefit management rather than benefit management with conflicting interests due to drug fulfillment. MedImpact uses information technology and human capital to improve the practice of managed care pharmacy. MedImpact partners with the nation\u2019s finest health plans, hospitals and employers to provide pharmacy benefit management services to more than 35 million members. Clients include corporations and employers, unions, managed care organizations, health plans, insurance carriers and third-party administrators, as well as local, state and federal employee programs. Founded in 1989, MedImpact is a private company with offices in San Diego, CA, and a state-of-the-art call and operations center in Tempe, AZ.MedImpact works with hundreds of organizations to provide pharmacy benefits. While benefit programs have many features in common, each program has a unique combination of offerings for its members. For example, programs may optionally include consumer-directed tools such as spending accounts, cash discount cards, member websites or a health management system. Delivering a custom website for each organization\u2019s operations staff and their members is nontrivial.In addition to the variability of individual benefit programs, MedImpact must comply with a wide spectrum of federal, state and local regulations. For instance, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide guidelines for eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment in Prescription Drug Benefit Plans, and websites must follow standards in terms of prescriptive language as well as for people with disabilities as specified by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. And the rapidly changing face of healthcare regulations in the United States has only increased the complexity of compliance.Over time, MedImpact has extensively invested in systems to meet the needs of clients and regulators. These systems were built using traditional website techniques and effectively meet current needs. However, as more and more client sites were desired, along with the need for supporting new regulatory and market requirements, it became apparent that a different approach was needed.Creating a Foundation for the FutureAfter extensive evaluation and research, MedImpact picked Liferay Portal as the base platform for new development and delivery of access to existing systems. MedImpact found the Liferay Portal framework to be a solid, industry standard and scalable solution that easily met the needs of the organization. Liferay scales well both in terms of performance but also in terms of operational self-service and eases the burden on IT. In addition, MedImpact selected Xtivia, Inc. to help guide and accelerate integration of the portal into these environments. The goal was to develop a portal strategy that could be easily replicated across many sites providing self-service content management to the business users and saving on costly IT labor.\u201cMedImpact found the Liferay Portal framework to be a solid, industry standard and scalable solution that easily met the needs of the organization,\u201d said Patrick Ravenel, Vice President, Software Development.Before engaging Xtivia, MedImpact diligently prepared plans for Liferay deployment and sent several people to Liferay training. This detailed preparation was essential. Even with this advanced preparation, the Xtivia initial assessment identified more than 25 topics for discussion, development \f3180321and resolution. The two companies worked together on these items during the engagement with an emphasis on mentoring and ongoing knowledge transfer.Much of the work focused on centralized authentication and authorization control, provision of custom look and feel and architecting a pattern for future sites. Some of the more detailed highlights include:1. Design and implement Single Sign-On (SSO)2. Integrate existing applications into portal  with SSO3. Integrate LDAP into Liferay with ongoing LDAP user and group data synchronization to Liferay4. Develop a comprehensive test suite and perform end-to-end SSO testing5. Develop login portlet and autologin filters6. Implement custom portlets and custom  theme styling7. Leverage velocity templates to create dynamic web contentFinally, Xtivia provided advice in many different areas, ranging from short-term \u201cdo it this way\u201d through long-term planning and direction. For instance, Xtivia advised on the configuration of development, QA, staging and production environments, as well as the performance tuning of the production cluster. Xtivia provided MedImpact with the professional experience needed from their lessons learned over many engagements and deployments.The team also developed plans for future deployment and replication of environments. All this was done in a way to effectively transfer knowledge to MedImpact.MedImpact expects the Liferay Portal solution to accomplish long-term outcomes for the PBM provider. As MedImpact moves all current web properties to Liferay, the compliance, marketing and client engagement teams can create and modify content and submit it for approval. This results in lower operational costs in the areas of new private-label sites and maintenance of current sites because, prior to Liferay, site content management required expensive IT software engineering resources to implement compliance and marketing content changes.MedImpact has plans to migrate all of its web portal technology to Liferay in the near future.\f"},{"filename":"MERCURY CASE STUDY - EN.pdf","text":"Mercury\u2019s customer portal has provided a foundation for our customer\u2019s digital experience while enabling the company to be responsive to its customers\u2019 preferences.Timothy Moore, Enterprise ArchitectChallenges\u2022 Multiple systems of record that needed to be integrated\u2022 High customer service costs due to paper communication and  call volume\u2022 Needed a platform that maintains compliance with regulationsResultsbetter self-serviceand an overall improvement  in customer experiencesingle sign onUnited multiple sites  and systems of recordreduced costsfor operations while providing more support  for Mercury sales agentsboost in consumer ratingsGained 45 points in an influential consumer  ratings study (J.D.

During Mercury\u2019s digital transformation, the company embarked on the creation of a comprehensive customer portal that would allow its customers to manage their total relationship with Mercury. Mercury\u2019s portal enables customers to access their policy information and pay their bills.In today\u2019s competitive business environment, where consumers can easily comparison shop on any device, customer portals need to be mobile-optimized, user friendly, secure and sophisticated\u2014which meant that Mercury needed to find a portal platform that could keep up with all these standards.After reviewing competitive portal offerings, Mercury decided on Liferay because it was Java-based and offered content management support, mobile readiness, flexible integration with Mercury ecosystems, and compatibility with key open source technologies like OpenID with Facebook and Google.A Way to View a Customer  as a Name, Not a NumberMercury wanted its new portal to achieve the  following benefits:\u2022 Enhance customer experience\u2022 Increase customer retention with improved  customer satisfaction\u2022 Stay competitive in the current marketplace\u2022 Reduce the volume of calls into the call center  and to Mercury agents\u2022 Reduce customer service costs by providing  self-service functionalities\u2022 Reduce printing and mailing costs by offering paperless communication\u2022 Maintain compliance with standards, statutes, regulations and policiesOne of the main challenges was uniting multiple systems of record that connected to back-end databases for car insurance, home insurance and other offerings. Mercury\u2019s team unified policy and customer information into one customer identification system, and with Liferay, connected each insurance ID number with a name and\u00a0customer profile. This allowed agents to identify people by name, rather than asking for a policy number. The tremendous amount of work that went into this simple change was the first big step toward Mercury launching its customer-centric strategy for the portal.Improving Customer\u2019s Digital ExperienceWith the new portal, customers are able to sign in once and access all their policies in one location. The portal is mobile-responsive, which allows people to access their information at any time and place. Customers can reach out to agents directly for help, or use self-service options like viewing important messages, making payments securely and customizing communications preferences for e-documents or printed documents. After the new portal was launched, Mercury surveyed its customers and continues to receive very positive feedback on the solution. Customers are pleased that they can manage their policies independently, without calling a service center or agents. In addition, the portal initiative helped Mercury gain 45 points in a J.D. Power study, due to the features in the new customer portal.Future plans for the portal include creating native mobile app functionality, more feature sets and more advanced communication options. The Liferay platform is ready to support all of Mercury\u2019s plans, giving the insurance company confidence that its portal will continue to match the expectations of its customers as it moves further into creating a technologically advanced portal.\f"},{"filename":"My Navy Portal Case Study - DIGITAL.pdf","text":"The ease with which Liferay works in the AWS environment and its system-friendly design has been a great help to us.Adam Brown, IBR\/Team Katmai, Senior ArchitectChallenges\u2022 Site performance needed dramatic improvement\u2022 Multiple legacy systems resulted in poor user experience\u2022 New solution needed to work within Navy\/Marine Corps intranetResultsfedramp certificationAchieved deployment in Amazon Gov Cloudrole-based personalizationHomepages and permissions automatically personalized according to rankbetter web experienceImproved web experience for 870,000 potential usersaward-winning serviceWon DoD CIO award for the\u00a0integrated solutionCase study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Remy 6Fill = Remy 3Case study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Remy 6Fill = Remy 3Case study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Liferay Blue 2Fill = Liferay Blue 10SummaryThe U.S. Navy\u2019s Sea Warrior Program Office needed to replace a group of legacy portals with a modern, consolidated solution.

It consolidates online human resources, education and training information in an interface that is personalized according to preferences and rank.In 2014, the Navy wanted to expand the portal to users in the entire navy, rather than a small subset. This required opening up the system to 870,000 potential users, and the existing solution couldn\u2019t deliver the necessary performance levels to make that a reality.A large part of the problem was that the portal was composed of several different systems and databases. Finally, the Navy decided to move everything to a single solution that could meet their performance requirements and deliver a great digital experience. It chose the development team at Team Katmai to implement everything on the Liferay platform, which already had buy-in from commanders and captains because of its known name. The extensibility in Liferay, as well as the ample community support and paid support, were also key to selection.Award-Winning Performance and FedRAMP CertificationTeam Katmai\u2019s first task was to do a complete rewrite of the codebase and re-architect the system for both better performance and an improved user\u00a0experience.One major advantage of Liferay was how easily it worked in the Amazon Web Services cloud environment. Team Katmai was able to receive FedRAMP certification for the portal and deploy it within the Amazon Government Cloud, and\u00a0can now take advantage of AWS security and development tools.The new portal launched with the ability to serve 40,000 sailors signing on at once within ten minutes, the site\u2019s highest traffic level. When tested, the new Liferay portal held up to this spike in users. In the future, Team Katmai plans to increase performance so the site can handle 50,000 and higher users in less than two minutes over the Navy\/Marine Corps intranet network.The Department of Defense was so impressed with the new My Navy site that it awarded Team Katmai a CIO award, the first time this award has ever gone to a contractor.User Satisfaction Jumps  in a Restrictive EnvironmentThe final product that Team Katmai delivered is still\u00a0evolving. As the Navy comes up with new feature requests or changes to the UI, Team Katmai can quickly implement them without disrupting what users see. The Navy\u2019s administrators are able to manage all content independently without getting involved on the technical side.Users praise the new portal for its ease of use, visual design and stellar performance, which can be difficult to achieve with the security and network restrictions in the Navy\/Marine Corps intranet.

It also wanted to provide a way for each school to tailor the site to suit  their specific needs and foster connection and engagement with the parents and carers  of its students, the result is the School Website Service.The School Website Service is available to all primary and secondary public schools in NSW and to date 2044 schools have a website (85% of all public schools in NSW).In 2011 DoE engaged with Permeance Technologies, a Liferay Platinum Partner, and selected the Liferay platform on which to develop the School Website Service. This followed successful  earlier implementations of both Staff and Student Portals for DoE NSW by Permeance, also running on the Liferay platform.Since the initial launch of the service the technology and original bespoke templates have evolved with the DoE School Website Service development team recently releasing a brand new responsive template for schools that use the service.

With a portfolio of diversified energy businesses, Osaka Gas is developing into a multi-energy services provider of natural gas, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), district heating and cooling, and other services. Including its affiliated enterprises, the Osaka Gas Group is also active in various non-energy business fields. CHALLENGEWith its various business units and diverse portfolio of services, Osaka Gas was faced  with the challenge of managing an abundance of data. The company\u2019s intranet aggregated not just content but a number of disparate applications, and it relied on a well-known commercial product portal system to do so. Over the course of eight years, however, users began to voice frustrations with the portal. Certain applications slowed the system, often leading to tedious reboots twice a week during business hours. Business users also complained about the abundance of links, which made it difficult to view information in a quick and simple way.As it neared the end of its service contract, Osaka Gas was presented with two options. One was to improve the current system, which would involve either an upgrade to a newer version of the portal or a potentially expensive scale-up of its hardware. Since this commercial portal was tied to an enterprise suite of products, the upgrade did not appear  to be a practical option as it would necessitate the replacement of the entire suite at once,  which involved huge risk. Scaling was not a better option, either. Due to interdependencies  with the hardware and operating system, Osaka Gas was reliant on installing hardware that had become out of date over time and eventually phased out of production.   FACTSLearn how Liferay Portal has helped Osaka Gas:\u2022\tSaved 150M Yen (approximately $1.8M USD) for five years\u2022\tProvides stability and usability without maintenance issues \fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMRESOLUTIONOne last option was to replace the portal system. While this also involved some level of risk, with concerns about stability and cost, Liferay surfaced as an attractive and viable solution. As an open source product, Liferay would provide access to the source code as well as implementation resources; at a tenth of the price of most competitors, any questions regarding operational and management costs would also be laid to rest. After much deliberation, it was decided that replacing their system with Liferay Portal would be the best alternative. As the primary integrator, Osaka Gas Information System Research Institute (OGIS) focused on integrating the Liferay cluster system and evaluating any possible fits and gaps between Liferay and the previous portal system. They were also tasked with installing the original portlets and assuming daily operations and maintenance.Since Osaka Gas hosts over 25,000 enterprise users, it was wary of major overhauls to the user interface. Fortunately, Liferay\u2019s flexible theming solutions and adherence to open standards like JSR-168 allowed the company to update the back-end system with minimal disruption to user experience. What\u2019s more, open source software allowed them the stability they had previously lacked. \u201cOur main goals were to achieve greater reliability and better cost management. Liferay accomplished that resoundingly,\u201d said Shigeru Nonami, Manager of Information & Communication Systems. Osaka Gas is now reaping the benefits of Liferay Portal on a daily basis. Users are touting the utility derived from features such as granular management of roles and authorizations (pages and portlets), easy page layout customization, and ease of integration between Liferay and the company\u2019s original collaboration systems (BBS, Scheduler) via Web Services. Osaka Gas is now able to quickly scale this intranet (and intra-organization communication) to give its family of subsidiary companies direct access to information as well.In the future, the company plans to explore options on how to expand their intranet, along with a possible update to increase system availability. For now, with its intranet portal in tow, Osaka Gas can focus on expanding its business and reaching broader populations with its various energy enterprises.061411\u201cOur main goals were to  achieve greater reliability and better cost management.Liferay accomplished that resoundingly.\u201dShiGeru NONamiManager of Information & Communication Systems\f"},{"filename":"Park Group plc Case Study.pdf","text":"Park Group has changed from being a slow and reactive company to a forward thinking organisation that embraces technology and digital products to deliver requirements to our\u00a0customers the way they want to receive them through the channels they want to use.Mick Saunders  Internet Solutions Development Manager, Park GroupChallenges\u2022 Highly regulated and inflexible systems delayed time to market  for digital products\u2022 Fast changing and diverse consumer touchpoints require continuous improvement in UX design and optimisation\u2022 IT was a bottleneck because marketing could not implement changes and UX optimisationsResultsFASTER TIME TO MARKETRapidly diversified business with self-service b2b portal through platform strategyEMPOWERED MARKETERSMarketers given autonomy to deliver new offerings and optimise conversion ratesCUSTOMER SATISFACTIONMore consistent experience across digital touchpointsGREAT USE OF ThE PORTAlRapid development of mobile responsive and native appsSummaryPark Group plc is the UK\u2019s leading provider of prepaid gift cards, multi-retailer gift vouchers and digital rewards services to corporate and consumer markets, with a turnover of \u00a3404.5m.

It has 200,000 employees across 64 countries and working in four main fields: innovative materials, construction products, building distribution and packaging. They are  all focused on the same strategy: the habitat of the future. Its industrial expertise and unique form of distribution proven over 350 years means that Saint-Gobain has huge innovation potential in terms of finding solutions to challenges in the areas of growth, energy sector,  and environmental protection. The organization is divided along three lines: sectors, functions (Finance, R&D, HR, Marketing\/Communication, Legal\/Fiscal and IT, which come under the holding company \u201cLa Compagnie Saint-Gobain\u201d), and countries (13 general delegations).  They coordinate around 50 activities carried out by 1,000 different companies\/brands, including Lapeyre, Point.P, Isover, La Plateforme du B\u00e2timent and KparK in France.ChallengeA quarter of Saint-Gobain\u2019s products did not exist five years ago. In fact, the Group\u2019s capacity for innovation saw it file close to 400 patents in 2013. To sustain this innovation \u2013 a key source  of growth and competitiveness \u2013 the group had to have a quality Information System, including a group intranet. This information portal, which is accessed daily by more than 12,000 users, is becoming outdated and lacks flexibility. Users log on either anonymously or using their login details, but response times are slow, especially in Asia. Their solution maintenance expired in 2013, which made the Digital Solutions team consider different tools. \u201cWe wanted users to be able to manage content and create web pages themselves\u201d, explained Sarah Mocchi, Communication Tools Project Manager. Saint-Gobain also had specific deadlines and cost constraints to meet, as well as wanting to reduce the number of its servers.Saint-Gobainwww.saint-gobain.comThe group\u2019s intranet portal has become a \u2018website factory\u2019 expertly handled by business users.Edouard Jopp\u00e9Portal & Collaboration Services Manager, Digital Solutions Team,  Saint-Gobain DSI Groupe\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDY140709ResolutionAfter considering the different options, Saint-Gobain chose Liferay because it was the only solution that fulfilled all of the group\u2019s criteria. There were several reasons behind their choice to migrate the existing portal to Liferay.The first was user acceptance. They found the portal to be more open and user-friendly.   In addition to technological considerations, the solution worked for the businesses.  \u201cLiferay reflected the mindset of our users\u201d, stated Edouard Jopp\u00e9, Portal & Collaboration Services Manager. \u201cThey instantly became aware of the solution\u2019s many benefits, and they quickly picked it up\u201d. The solution was also thought to be more robust and scalable, and its ability to integrate with third-party applications was another draw. Many users accessed documents (with the internal document management tool), collaborative platform communities, stock prices, etc. through applications (portlets).Furthermore, other solutions were thought to be too \u201cFrench\u201d. Half of the technical team working on the portal solution is based in India, so online resources and user forums contribute to increasing the expertise of the team in India. The flexibility and readiness of Open Source and Java technologies were also key factors in the decision-making process. Finally, the cost of the solution and implementation deadlines were also considered.  Liferay definitely responded to all of Saint-Gobain\u2019s needs.Business Value AddedThe main added value for Saint-Gobain was the fact that users could contribute autonomously and that management of the different sites could be delegated to the different businesses. In less than an hour, the Digital Solutions team had created a website with the \u201cSaint-Gobain\u201d theme and had trained users. The team doesn\u2019t insist on one particular model but does ensure consistency in the navigation. Users can then manage their websites in the way they see fit. They can create and manage their own pages and content, and instantly see their members using the \u201cstaging or remote staging\u201d function. This function, which is active on all sites,  is particularly useful to business users. \u201cIt means we don\u2019t have to stick to one model; we can be more flexible\u201d, said Edouard Jopp\u00e9. \u201cThe group\u2019s intranet portal has become a website factory\u201d, he continued. Today, we have 255 websites, which are either public or restricted by access. Information governance is significant and the team will soon be able to more accurately calculate access statistics for the different pages. The financial ROI is also impressive. Even taking into consideration the fact that the two portals existed in parallel for a while, maintenance costs were significantly reduced and the number of servers was cut in half. \u201cThe cost of migrating the existing solution to Liferay was offset in one year by the savings we made through subscriptions and reducing the number of servers\u201d,  Edouard Jopp\u00e9 pointed out. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t encountered any technical or business headaches during migration.  Users have all been very enthusiastic because Liferay is so much simpler and more flexible than our previous solution, so user acceptance has been straightforward. In the beginning, our partner SQLI helped us with the project\u2019s framework and architecture, and implemented some specific developments. Now everything is handled by our teams in France and India. Nevertheless, the team is smaller than before because Liferay natively integrates several functions, such as the multilingual element, which for us is crucial\u201d.Liferay has fully met all of the expectations of the Saint-Gobain Digital Solutions team.  Portal traffic has doubled. 24,000 people now use it daily without any deterioration in service, and with faster response times in Asia for user logins.  \u201cLiferay has completely transformed the way we work. Decentralized terminal management has meant that the support team is free to concentrate on other value added tasks\u201d, concluded Mr Jopp\u00e9.In the future, Saint-Gobain plans to continue consolidating its different business intranet portals. Furthermore, the IT team is now looking into mobility and making the portal more easily internally accessible to mobile users on tablets and smartphones.\f"},{"filename":"Schneider Electric Case Study - EN.pdf","text":"Our partnership with XTIVIA has been a fantastic experience.

Their immediate need was for a solution that would allow thousands of users around the world to search and download software, including files running into hundreds of megabytes. Instead of settling for a narrow solution, Schneider seized the opportunity to reimagine their entire information hub. Their roadmap included a partner extranet, a key public website, a marketing collateral mobile app, and various software tools for their customers, partners, and employees around the world. To accomplish this, they needed a platform that was agile and flexible, bringing together an array of services in a way that was easy to manage.A Versatile Platform to Meet All NeedsLiferay, a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, was chosen by Schneider Electric for its low total cost of ownership (TCO), business ability, and rich out-of-the-box functionality, including a strong content management system, identity management capabilities, ability to leverage a public cloud infrastructure, and extensibility as a\u00a0development\u00a0platform. Schneider Electric chose XTIVIA, winner of Liferay\u2019s Partner of the Year award for three years in a row, for its proven leadership in the portal space and their ability to work with the E-Business team to implement its strategic vision.The XTIVIA team worked closely with the E-Business team stakeholders to define the priorities for the Liferay-based Exchange application and setup the Liferay environments utilizing the The XTIVIA team worked closely with the E-Business team stakeholders to define the priorities for the Liferay-based Exchange application and setup the Liferay environments utilizing the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. First, the team built an easy-to-navigate system and leveraged Liferay\u2019s AUI framework for a responsive theme. Custom responsive layouts provided a clean, professional, and consistent look and feel to the site, optimizing the user experience for mobile devices and tablets.Next, XTIVIA used the workflow feature of Liferay for document and software package uploads and \f3190307implemented an end-user oriented \u201cdocument search\u201d portlet that supported filters, continuous search results (infinite scroll), the ability to identify and show the related assets, and the ability to track searches and downloads. The XTIVIA team enhanced the core Liferay search capability with XTIVIA search innovations and a robust SolrCloud search infrastructure which greatly enhanced the performance of the search queries. XTIVIA also ensured that the Schneider E-Business staff were trained in managing and operating the portal on a day-to-day basis and had the ability to update the content as required to keep the site fresh.To fortify security, the XTIVIA team implemented features that required users to be registered and verified before they had the ability to download assets from the Exchange system. The team also set up Single-Sign-On (SSO) between the Exchange system and multiple applications within the organization. And finally, XTIVIA worked together with the Schneider E-Business team to redesign and rebuild the user interface of the Exchange site by adding key functionality improvements in the search and presentation of assets for their target audience.XTIVIA enjoys a successful partnership with the E-Business team and has helped build new applications based on the Liferay platform. The\u00a0XTIVIA team successfully delivered the Transition Portal application that would promote upgrades to their existing customers with legacy systems and transition them to the new building automation platform. XTIVIA also completed a project to integrate Schneider\u2019s mobile marketing platform with the Liferay platform to provide a conduit for assets to be available to the internal Sales and Marketing teams in a professional and aesthetically pleasing manner on their marketing platform. Exceptional Customer Experience that Continues to EvolveThe Exchange was launched by the E-Business team in the first quarter of 2014, and it quickly became the go-to resource for Schneider Electric\u2019s partners and employees around the world. The Exchange provided users with the ability to search and filter the results based on specific keywords and the responsive web design ensured that the site was still functional when they were on the road at their respective client sites. Schneider received rave reviews from their customers, affirming that the new platform is providing a dynamic and enjoyable user experience. Even their own staff see day-to-day advantages as well as the workflow and content management enabled by Liferay helps increase productivity for both portal management and internal marketing efforts.Liferay continues to provide value to the Schneider E-Business team as a complete application development platform and not just a Content Management System. XTIVIA and Schneider Electric are working together as a team on additional Liferay-based projects to continually improve the current platform.\f"},{"filename":"SCHOTT AG Case Study_EnglishUS_Letter_Web.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYInnovators of Specialty Glass ProductsSCHOTT is one of the leading international technology groups in the areas of specialty glass and glass ceramics and active in the household appliances, pharmaceuticals, electronics,  optics and transportation sectors. A Need for Improved Communication Across RegionsSCHOTT maintains its competitive advantage globally by developing and launching innovative products to the market quickly. To do this, they are reliant on effective communication between staff in 35 regions worldwide. Deeply embedded in their corporate culture are these fundamental components: dialogue, exchange and the transfer of knowledge. They started looking for a new intranet solution because their former intranet was lagging, was limited in distributing information to the right groups at the right time, and lacked interaction functionalities.SCHOTT conducted a comprehensive analysis interviewing and surveying each group in the organization. The result was a list of requirements of over 80 categories. Liferay was chosen  out of 78 competing software applications.After a detailed evaluation, Liferay stood out as the most suitable platform for us,\u201d said Andreas Beeres, CIO of SCHOTT AG. \u201cThe feature set was perfectly suited, and the open source concept and transparent development of the platform fit well with our company. \u201cAnd thanks to the high level of flexibility of the Liferay solution, we are able to respond to requirements which cannot be fully planned in advance. All of this makes Schott well prepared for future changes.\u201d In BriefOrganization: Schott Country\/Region:  Headquarters in Germany, offices worldwide Industry:  Manufacturing Use Case:  Employee Portal, Intranet SCHOTT New intranet drives effective knowledge sharing among 10,000+ employees worldwide.  www.us.schott.comExperience has shown that we made the right decision when it came to choosing Liferay. We have achieved all specified objectives and have managed to do this within a significantly shorter timescale than originally planned.Andreas BeeresCIO  SCHOTT AG\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYOld Intranet Replaced CompletelyIn order to completely replace the old intranet, all inventory data was migrated to the Liferay solution by a specified date. More than 12,000 pieces of data content from the old intranet was transferred within  a few hours using a sophisticated import\/export mechanism.  Blogs, personal profiles, networking opportunities, the internal  job portal and an innovation platform were also implemented to  the new intranet. The IT service provider PRODYNA, which was charged with implementing the project, designed SCHOTTnet as a central portal solution with global access for all locations. This in turn guaranteed consistent communication and cooperation across different sites for the globally operating group.Cost Savings of 60 percent,  Time to Market in 3 Months The company divided its intranet into different core application areas, including company information, document downloads and collaboration. For every SCHOTTnet section, the responsible parties determined whether they wanted to \u201cmake or buy\u201d each section. They thoroughly investigated whether it was possible to meet the requirements using applications available on the market. Although solutions existed, many economic factors supported the \u2018make\u2019 alternative. Development using a combination of Liferay standard modules as a basis always ended up being more cost effective. Compared to buying and  implementing a dedicated solution, the savings amounted to more than 60 percent. In addition, using Liferay to deliver the system  shortened the project time to market from six months to three months.Mission Accomplished: All Staff InvolvementToday, more than 10,000 staff members are working worldwide on  the new intranet portal. More than 2,000 people exchange dialogue on a broad range of subjects in over 35 communities. Furthermore,  an emphasis on usability has led to user acceptance of the portal.  The company has provided its staff with an opportunity for exchanging information whenever they consider it to be necessary. \u201cSCHOTTnet has also injected a new philosophy into our intranet,\u201d Beeres said. \u201cPreviously, the articles had to go through an approval process, which is now no longer necessary. Each staff member can get involved and there are only a few rights and role restrictions in place. This concept also inspires us in other areas and helps to handle information openly as well as promoting a culture of sharing.\u201d New Intranet Already Leading to New SCHOTT ProjectsSCHOTTnet\u2019s pipeline module allows more than 120 innovation managers from all group divisions to develop, discuss and evaluate  new ideas that lead to new projects. This occurred two months after  the platform launched with a team of 14 people across different disciplines, geographies and hierarchy levels who were able to work together virtually on a new idea that is already eligible for patent protection. With SCHOTTnet\u2019s job module, recruiting efforts also have been improved through integration of external online recruiting systems, leading to a consistent process from the inside to the outside and vice versa, without any media disruptions or duplicate efforts. Further Investments in Mobile,  Employee ParticipationSCHOTTnet is a good example of a solution on Liferay that starts  with a classic intranet and adds greater functionalities over time. \u201cExperience has shown that we made the right decision when it came to choosing Liferay. We have achieved all specified objectives and have managed to do this within a significantly shorter timescale than originally planned, \u201d Beeres said. \u201cIn future, we will continue to invest in SCHOTTnet and provide additional modules that make the Liferay Portal available for those on the go. In addition, we will integrate other systems to provide our business and service units with an optimal digital working environment. The next major steps are to extend our market intelligence platform in SCHOTTnet, adapt to mobile use and, above all, integrate staff that are not included in the company-wide network.\u201d150909The Liferay Difference\u2022 Cost savings of 60 percent using Liferay standard modules for development.\u2022 Time to market on project cut in half to three months.\u2022  Improved user experiences with mobile responsive sites.\u2022 Knowledge sharing among 10,000 employees so far in 35 regions.\u2022 Intranet module for 120 innovation managers to develop new ideas.The SCHOTT technology group is present on the market in 35 countries and active in sectors including the domestic appliance industry, pharmaceutics, electronics, optics and transportation.

Based on a diversified universal banking model, the Group combines financial solidity with a strategy of sustainable growth, and aims to be the reference for relationship banking, recognised on its markets,  close to clients, chosen for the quality and commitment of its teams.Societe Generale has been playing a vital role in the economy for 150 years. With more than 148,000 employees, based in 76 countries, it accompanies 30 million clients throughout the world on a daily basis, offering advice and services to individual, corporate and institutional customers  in three complementary core businesses: Retail Banking in France, International Retail Banking,  and Corporate and Investment Banking, Private Banking, Asset Management and Securities Services. ChallengeIn 2010, Societe Generale launched a vast project to bring together its 169 intranet sites - 93 in French and 76 in English - on a single platform. These sites had been designed using technology that was considered obsolete, with every request often necessitating specific developments. Facing an increase in traffic - 4 million page views per month - and a growing need for additional features, the Group decided to turn to a more efficient solution that would also keep costs down. \u201cWe needed a more scalable solution to provide innovative, web 2.0 features, but we also needed to cut our maintenance costs by 20%,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois Dreuilhe, Head of the Web Department.Reworking existing tools is always a big challenge. It is complex, to say the least. On the  one hand, migration to the new solution has to happen quickly to avoid paying maintenance costs on two solutions at once. On the other, it is an opportunity to rethink certain sites and to reduce their number, which means implementing a change management process.Overhauling 169 intranet sites is no mean feat.  The wide range of features offered by Liferay made it easier for users to accept the change and get to grips with the new solution.  Also, its flexibility means we can now create a site in  3 days instead of one month.Fran\u00e7ois DreuilheHead of the Web DepartmentSoci\u00e9te G\u00e9n\u00e9rale An innovative intranet portal for an optimal user experiencewww.societegenerale.com\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDY150710Finally, creating a new site needed to be much easier and involve business teams. \u201cBefore, you needed over a month to create a new site and business teams were not able to implement it independently, which created a huge workload for IT teams,\u201d adds Fran\u00e7ois Dreuilhe.ResolutionThe Liferay solution was selected from a call for tenders launched in March 2010. Its native web factory function sets it apart from the competition. It makes it possible to roll out sites using an automated, industrialized process based on pre-defined templates, which considerably reduces the time taken to produce a new site.To start with, a pilot site is migrated to Liferay to test out the tool and get a better idea of how long it takes to rework a site. Users are involved form the start to ensure that all their needs are taken into account.Business Value AddedSociete Generale now moved from 169 sites to 40 multilingual sites. Some of them have  been completely rethought. For instance, 13 sites have been combined into just one.  The multilingual function allows users to add as many languages as they want to a site without having to duplicate it, compared to the previous version.Another development that has been warmly welcomed by users is that it now only  takes 3 days to provide a new site, rather than a month. Besides, business teams are now much more autonomous. \u201cSite section managers can update their content without having  to have any special technical knowledge. IT teams create site templates in line with the  new graphic guidelines and then let them deal with all the content management,\u201d  explains Ingrid Broussillon, Product Owner. The setting-up of a Users\u2019 Club and the organization of regular trainings have encouraged user involvement and facilitated change management.In addition, the new 2.0 features offer an optimal user experience. The new version  moves away from standard browsing to personalized and dynamic browsing. \u201cUsers can personalize their home page so that they only see the information they are interested in.  They are also provided with suggested articles thanks to the contribution of everyone,\u201d  adds Ingrid Broussillon. Indeed, each post can be rated or commented upon, providing a  useful way of gauging user satisfaction levels as well as suggesting content to users via different categories: most read, most commented, highest rated, etc.The blog, newsletter and alert features also add a lot of value. They allow the Group to regularly inform users about the latest news, and eventually boost the number of visits.Finally, the new portal represents an opportunity to promote digital accessibility. \u201cThat is a key priority for us. It is essential for disabled users to access the information they need. That could mean incorporating voice synthesis, or ensuring that documents are formatted in such a way that they are easily accessible to the visually impaired,\u201d explains Ingrid Broussillon. A quality label has been created to raise contributors\u2019 awareness and reward the best efforts. A dozen or so sites have already achieved the label.Alongside this project, the Group portal was overhauled and rolled out in late 2013  with Liferay version 6.1. It represents a real \u201cDigital Workplace\u201d that offers customized and customizable tools for each user, as well as automatic login with its profile to the enterprise social network.In keeping with the provision of 80,000 tablets to employees as part of the  \u201cDigital4all\u201d program, all intranet sites are now available on tablets and smartphones  via the Societe Generale app store.\f"},{"filename":"SOUTH WORCESTERSHIRE CASE STUDY.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMORgAnIsAtIOnSW2 is the ICT Shared Service for the three south Worcestershire councils: Malvern Hills District Council, Worcester City Council and Wychavon District Council. They support approximately 1000 users through their Customer Self Service Portal, and about 120 traditional client server business applications. SW2 has adopted a self-service view of business, putting the customer first and making end-to-end interactions fully available online as much as possible. Their strategy is to consolidate on and migrate to a web-based  infrastructure, basing as many applications in the browser as possible. This has led to the implementation of more open source software applications and tools.ChALLEngESW2 has limited resources and a small development team who decided it was worthwhile creating their own middleware systems to link web applications to back office systems. Internally, they had three different intranet solutions (SharePoint Server 2007,  SharePoint and traditional CMS), and different methods of application development.  They required an intranet solution that offered a portal as well as a development environment on top of a CMS. Externally, they sought a solution which would help them achieve their self service goals and also offer the development base they needed.REsOLutIOnThe SW2 team evaluated SharePoint, Alfresco and MindTouch, but none offered everything required in a single offering, or fit the ICT Strategy to move to open source solutions and to provide self service to users. Liferay met these requirements and was chosen to replace SharePoint. With Liferay Portal EE, SW2 appreciated the availability  of support and training as well as the large user base.http:\/\/www.malvernhills.gov.ukSouth Worcestershire District Councilswww.malvernhills.gov.uk\u201cLiferay is an excellent fit  with our business strategy,  allows for rapid application  development and offers a  great return on investment.\u201dAnDy BALDWinHead of Finance & Resources\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMSetting up Liferay Portal was very easy, and it allowed SW2 to quickly replicate the sites and features they had in SharePoint. The built-in applications enabled them to quickly  set up sites for teams, and sped up the migration to Liferay. Using Linux running on VMware servers and a MySQL database made it easy to take snapshots before  upgrades or deploying solutions. The service areas using Liferay picked it up right away, and the standard look and feel was much preferred to that of SharePoint.  Liferay offered the CMS, development environment and portal server needed to run the Customer Self Service Portal while providing a consistent interface for the public.BusInEss vALuE AddEdThe applications developed in Liferay are helping the councils to accelerate the channel shift to online applications and speed up interactions for both customers and back  office staff. This is now reducing the need for costly face-to-face, telephone or  written interactions.Internally, the ROI has been much greater than using SharePoint and, after moving to Liferay Portal, SW2 now has a single system and a central place for employees at the councils to find information and work collaboratively. Much of the data the councils hold, as well as some of the legacy applications that staff use, have their own expensive web front end, and the consolidation removes this cost.070212\f"},{"filename":"Spire Case Study.pdf","text":"\u201cThis solution delivers an  engaging   user experience and homogenizes  our complex back-end systems.Deborah Banks, Director at SpireChallenges\u2022 Replace multiple disparate portals for a unified user experience\u2022 Homogenize two ERP systems, two payment processing systems and two mobile workforce management systems\u2022 Give customers real-time account updates, billing information and energy usage dataResultscomprehensive service platformSelf-service tools quickly support customer needsimproved customer satisfactionComprehensive online service tools provide customers with the support they need, when they need itsuccessful integrationConnecting customer information and billing systemsstreamlined Back-end systemsPortal increases business operations efficiency and reduces agent processing timesCase study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = LR-Blue 2Fill = LR-Blue 10Case study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Remy 6Fill = Remy 3Case study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Remy 6Fill = Remy 3Case study icons are small scale, so keep them simple and easily recognizableStroke = Remy 6Fill = Remy 3Providing Modern Customer ExperiencesFifth-largest publicly traded gas utility in the U.S.  creates state-of-the-art customer portal with Liferay DXPSummarySpire serves more than 1.7 million customers across Missouri, Mississippi and Alabama with a self-service customer experience portal  built on Liferay DXP.spireenergy.com\/about- my-accountIn Briefindustry:Energycountry\/region:United Statesuse case:Customer Portalkey features:Role-Based Access Controls,  Web Content Management, Custom Application Development, Mobile-Friendly Design, Enterprise Integration, Single Sign-On, Identity Management, Online User Dashboard\f2Empowering an Energy CompanySpire, is an energy company serving 1.7 million customers across Missouri, Mississippi and Alabama.

The organization connects roughly 480 tennis clubs  with 150,000 active tennis players throughout the region. Tennis Vlaanderen provides the  best possible support for clubs and their members, and fosters professionalism and quality within the clubs. Its mission is to make tennis accessible at all levels for all ages and to train top international players. Tennis Vlaanderen was founded in 1979 under the name VTV.  Since 2014, the federation has continued to celebrate and promote Flemish tennis as  Tennis Vlaanderen.ChallengeTennis Vlaanderen aimed to provide its annually growing membership with information  and services as efficiently and effectively as possible. The organization therefore looked for  a flexible platform that provided modern functionalities such as online registration and payment, and reservations for tennis courts or tournaments. They needed a solution that fully integrated with the Oracle database as well as the existing ELIT system for members, clubs, and tournaments. These had been used for years to record details of members, officials, ratings and results. Tennis Vlaanderen also wishes to face the future independently\u2014without the intervention  of IT companies and therefore without high additional costs.SolutionIn Liferay Portal, Tennis Vlaanderen found a platform that is easy to use and manage,  and which effectively works with the existing database. This makes it easy for members, trainers, officials, and clubs to instantly access a wealth of relevant, personalized information. Tennis Vlaanderen also now provides members with real time news and tournament information. A number of specific user groups were identified\u2014youth, official, top talent, starter, parent, board member, press, supporter, trainer\u2014and given access to the information relevant for its own users.

The new digital application form is processed completely automatically, resulting in greater speed and fewer errors.  People can become members instantly, so they can start playing tennis and enjoy membership benefits without delay. Membership is flexible and easy to manage, for example for parents who can easily add family members to their membership. OFFICIALS AND TRAINERSClubs use the platform to search for officials and schedule the right people for their tournaments and inter-club competition. This not only improves efficiency, but also controls  the quality of the organization and its activities. Courses are easier and quicker to arrange, which means more lessons are given, leading to increased revenue. Registration and payment take place online, minimizing the risk of human error. Finally, as course fees are  paid upfront online, no complicated and resource-heavy procedures are required for  chasing payments.RESPONSIVE DESIGNThe Tennis Vlaanderen Liferay site is entirely responsive. Members can consult the portal at any time and from any location using their smartphones, tablets or other mobile devices.Business Added ValueThe implementation of the Tennis Vlaanderen platform on Liferay Portal has resulted in a growing number of site visits and as many as 95,000 unique logins per year. Active involvement via social media has also increased. The service level for members has risen, while the management costs for Tennis Vlaanderen have decreased.

With over 20,000 engineers and researchers, Thales has a unique capability to design and deploy equipment, systems, and services to meet the most complex security requirements.  In a world that is increasingly mobile, interconnected and independent, the Group\u2019s technologies provide relevant information at the right time to make the best decision possible.  Thales reported sales of \u20ac13 billion in 2014.ChallengeA Customer portal project was launched in 2005, following requests from certain Customers, such as the French Army.  Its objective: to facilitate access to the different Thales services through a single point of access, thus replacing the individual portals used by separate entities within the Group. However, the number of Customers increased rapidly and the platform quickly reached its limits, particularly in terms of reliability. An audit was therefore carried out in 2009, looking at the existing technology as well as project governance. \u201cWe were experiencing repeated technical issues such as unscheduled service interruptions. The existing platform was clearly no longer sufficiently reliable to meet with the quality of service levels expected by our Customers. We had also identified the need for an adequately resourced central team to lead a project of this nature. Consequently, a dedicated team was soon put together and a call for tenders was launched in order to seek a reliable and scalable portal solution\u201d, explains Didier Danthez, Portal Applications and ITSM Manager.Thales Global ServicesSecure and intelligent online services to increase operational  efficiency for THALES Group\u2019s Customers.www.thalesgroup.comOperational efficiency is critical for our civil and defense customers. With around 30 value-added online services, Customer OnLine facilitates their day-to-day operations. Case tracking, purchasing,  24\/7 contact... everything is done to address the different needs of 3,300 active users, across 124 countries.\u201dDidier DanthezIS Manager, Portal & ITSM\fwww.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYBut it was not simply a question of reusing the existing services.  New functionalities, interactivity, improved user experience\u2026 every aspect was scrutinized in order to devise a new and innovative tool that was capable of supporting new income-generating services.  For example, it was a requirement that each of the separate entities within the Group could offer its own services, including some as  pay-for services, with a simple means of connecting to their back office systems.ResolutionIn 2009, various open source or proprietary solutions were evaluated. Liferay was selected because of its ability to meet the technical and budgetary requirements. Furthermore, it was a solution that had attracted positive Customer feedback, which was reassuring to the Group in making its decision.\u201cWe were looking for a solution that was easy to implement, based on market standards, capable of integrating our existing applications  and that could sit within the highly secure environment of our  extranet hosted at Thales Services. We were also very mindful of  the support quality. The level of responsiveness of Liferay teams  was indeed in line with the commitments they had made\u201d,  details Didier Danthez. In terms of organization, the French Information Technology Department is now carrying the project forward and coordinating its implementation at a global level.Business Value AddedThe Customer OnLine portal is a success, replacing all of the locally developed solutions that were in place. Cutting across the entire Group\u2019s civil and defense activities, it has a constantly increasing visit rate.  In 2014, 8,400 connections were logged per month, which is a 28% increase compared to the previous year.The 3,300 active users, across 124 countries, personalize their space and access information and services that are relevant to their business activity. \u201cThey are provided with a personal, dynamic and collaborative solution that became a very effective working tool. We offer them support  and\/or operation of equipment or systems throughout their entire lifecycle as well as operational support\u201d, states Didier Danthez.This single point of entry masks the many different information systems within Thales and makes it possible to channel all relevant requests to each individual entity. \u201cFor example, if a Customer reports a product-related incident, their request will be automatically routed to the entity responsible for product maintenance in that area. A Customer using a radar supplied by an entity in the Netherlands and telecommunications equipment supplied by an entity in France will be able to interact with these entities via a single interface and identical procedures even though the tools that these two entities are using might be very different\u201d,  adds Didier Danthez. The provided portfolio of services, some of which are available  by subscription or billed on a per-usage basis, are organized into  four categories: Discover: this category contains all the information relating to shared interest communities as well as catalogues of products and services, such as training courses. Contact: in just three clicks, Customers are able to confirm a new order. They can also send requests relating to their products or services and track the progress of a request in real time. Examples of such requests include incident reports, quotes, online training subscription, etc.Maintain and Operate: among other features, Customers are able to look up maintenance documentation, find out about risks of obsolescence on their system, track the progress of repairs and orders for replacement parts, or access services that are very specific to the systems they use. For example, airline companies using a Thales flight management system on their aircraft can enjoy access to Thales databases in order to optimize their calculator according to the lines they are operating. A subscription is also available for receiving information about changes to navigation maps and for downloading updates.Share: collaborative working spaces, forums, FAQ\u2026 users can share documents or discuss on common issues. A search engine as well as a role management and document versions enhance these spaces.  The services within this category are supported by native Liferay functions, whereas some other services are specific developments. \u201cThe portal allows us to formulate innovative solutions to address the issues encountered by our Customers in order to make efficiency gains for them and for Thales as well. With Liferay, we have clearly improved our levels of responsiveness in terms of developing new services and  adapting existing services to new requirements. The central project team develops and maintains the Group-wide and local e-Services. We also provide training and support for teams based in the international entities. The local teams carry out administration tasks for their e-Services,  develop interfaces with their information systems, and manage access profiles for their Customers by applying the Group rules as defined within the project\u201d, concludes Didier Danthez. In 2012, Customer OnLine was rolled out to Supplier OnLine, a portal for suppliers featuring common and specific services. Going forward,  the aim is to continue deployment of the solution, to address the regulatory requirements of new member countries, and to develop  new services.150925\f"},{"filename":"The GLOBE Case Study Digital.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYWorldwide Scientific DiscoveryThe Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is a worldwide hands-on, primary and secondary school-based science and education program founded on Earth Day 1995.

GLOBE promotes the teaching and learning of science, enhances environmental literacy  and stewardship, and promotes scientific discovery. GLOBE also supports students,  teachers and scientists worldwide to collaborate with each other on inquiry-based investigations of the Earth system. Upgrading Fifteen Years of Legacy Systems and DataThe GLOBE data and information system (DIS, including web interface) originally utilized a variety of technologies established over 15 years of operations, which became difficult to maintain and enhance. GLOBE and its partners wanted to develop a new, modern and collaborative environment, while maintaining the content, features and legacy data associated with the original system. The new framework was required to support over 30,000 organizations and over 100,000 monthly visitors with a role structure that provided appropriate permissions and controls for a large community of international users.A Modern Approach to Content Management  and CollaborationNASA wanted a new approach to redesign and rebuild GLOBE\u2019s DIS.

Improving Daily Experiences for CustomersU.S. Bank faced a significant challenge. Their customers in Securities Services were forced to log in, access data and interact with their accounts using multiple, disparate sites coupled with manual processes. Some application functionality overlapped. Multiple log ins and  different user experiences within each application made day-to-day activities difficult to manage and cumbersome. Data showed that users, who include asset managers and anyone with an interest in a trust account, rarely logged into the applications, and client adoption was low. Clients were demanding improved online tools that streamlined interaction with U.S. Bank Securities Services. Ultimately, the lack of unified account access and management was giving U.S. Bank competitors an advantage.Unifying Systems into a Single, Comprehensive PortalU.S. Bank needed a single system for customers to access all information, providing a consistent user experience.

Liferay was selected because of competitive pricing allowing lower Total Cost of Ownership, meeting their price point without sacrificing functionality. U.S. Bank also sought an open source solution for the rich network  of community support that they could take advantage of as needed. Using Liferay, U.S. Bank developed an innovative portal called  Pivot where users are able to interact based on their needs.  Whether searching for details on particular assets or obtaining an account document, U.S. Bank clients can access it all from within a single web site. Clients have access to several different new tools that enable them to perform their job better and make decisions faster.Built on Liferay, U.S. Bank\u2019s Pivot delivers the following:\u2022  Exposing core system deal data, including cash, holdings, and trade information that was previously sent over email.\u2022  Providing a centralized document management area for all files and reports.\u2022  Proactively pushing critical alerts around deal data and milestones.\u2022  Creating a tool that allows clients to see \u201cWhat has changed\u201d  over time.\u2022  Building self-service reporting capabilities that allow clients to access historical deal and compliance data. As an organization, U.S. Bank also required a solution that was developer friendly, allowing for scalable growth and integration with existing enterprise software and infrastructure. With Liferay, U.S. Bank was able to run multiple development streams at the same time by keeping business capabilities packaged as self-contained portlets, which could be deployed to shared environments. This foundation provided the ability to share the infrastructure, making setting up new sites faster. They could test one portlet versus the entire application.Development benefits achieved include:\u2022 Integration with existing enterprise systems.\u2022  Connected to document management system for access to files and documents.\u2022 Decreased implementation time to roll out new business lines.\u2022  Reduced development time, testing efforts, and infrastructure investment.Faster Time to Market, Improved  Client Growth and RetentionWith Liferay, U.S. Bank was able to take and deliver solutions to business lines and get up and running without starting from square one\u2014a significant cost savings.

Its main business interests include magazines, exhibitions, conferences, awards, information products and websites.Searching for Consistency Across All BrandsWith over 100 brands using multiple web platforms, UBMi was suffering from a lack of coordination and communication. The distribution of content across multiple platforms became restrictive and time-consuming. There was difficulty in supporting each platform due to the shortage of skilled resources for the various tools. As a result, business groups were unable to accommodate last minute changes to campaigns since respective items had to be planned well in advance.Moreover, with expensive licensing, maintenance and support models, it was difficult to find proper resources due to the wide scope of knowledge needed to understand all systems. Upgrades were virtually impossible. Also, without access to the source code, in the case of the platform provider filing for bankruptcy, customers would be left with neither support nor a future upgrade path. UBMi had to lean heavily on external suppliers in order to mitigate some of the risk.After experiencing huge losses in time, money and productivity, UBMi realized their need  to employ a standardized platform across all brands.UBMi Multinational media giant rolls out over 70 websites with  new standardized solution.

The company was looking for a new platform for its product VantagePoint,  a business services portal that integrates disparate enterprise systems, turning data into a unified, real-time and personalized dashboard that is customized for end users based on their roles. The portal technologies that Unisys had tried in the past were either too expensive or proprietary. The company wanted to make a shift to open source in order to take advantage of  its lower cost and standards-based technology. In addition,  the new solution needed to have powerful integration features and be configurable for different clients. After a review of options,  Unisys chose Liferay for its multitenancy capabilities, customizable UI and flexibility.\u201cThe best news I ever received was when I found out I could do persona-based computing,\u201d said Richard Phelps, the Global Director of User Experience at Unisys. \u201cIndividual users are trying to perform very specific job functions, and we had the ability to help them with Liferay.\u201dCompelling Customer Experience  Powered by Open SourceOne of the first successes Unisys saw with Liferay was significant cost savings through multitenancy. The company supports about 70 clients on a single Liferay license, accounting for 6,000  unique interactions each day. Other solutions required a license fee per user, resulting in more than 10x the cost per client.In moving VantagePoint to Liferay, Unisys aimed to create  an intuitive and personalized user interface for its customers.  The company used Liferay\u2019s modularity to design a card-based dashboard with the ability to create personas and views with aggregated data that is useful to individual users, based on their role in the enterprise. Its purpose is to give people the ability to see if everything is going well at a glance. \u201cThe ability to go from \u2018It\u2019s broken\u2019 to \u2018Here\u2019s why\u2019 in two clicks is really one of the greatest innovations,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cEvery client we show it to wants it.\u201d With the new front end, VantagePoint is turning out to be a primary differentiator for Unisys.VantagePoint has more than a compelling user experience.  The company primarily uses Liferay as an application integration platform, and its flexibility makes it fast and easy to add new applications as needed. Currently, VantagePoint integrates 6 \u2013 7 applications, and the company has plans to add more in the future, including facilities crisis management, stealth technology, security management and mobile environment management. One Solution for 3,000+  Mobile ConfigurationsAnother key benefit of the Liferay platform was its move to responsive web design. As a company that serves enterprises, Unisys has no control of what end users have in their hands. They need to account for every combination of mobile technology \u2014 more than 3,000 combinations of devices and operating systems. This isn\u2019t a problem that could be solved one device at a time with apps. Liferay\u2019s responsive web design makes it easy to adapt to the environment and the device, which really made a difference in Unisys\u2019s mobile approach. Now, the VantagePoint dashboard adapts to any screen \u2014 desktop, tablet or smartphone \u2014 to deliver real-time views of what\u2019s happening across people, operations and the business.A Winning CombinationUnisys often receives requests from other solution providers to look at their technology, but they haven\u2019t seen anything on the  market like Liferay. People see the VantagePoint dashboard and assume that it simply takes data from a common source and  displays it. But it\u2019s really the powerful back-end integration that makes Liferay so valuable. The combination of an excellent user  experience and the technological capability to deliver the best  services are what makes VantagePoint a differentiator for Unisys.\u201cWe would not be doing what we\u2019re doing today if it wasn\u2019t  for Liferay,\u201d Phelps said.170310\f"},{"filename":"VMware Case Study.pdf","text":"www.liferay.comLIFERAY CASE STUDYInnovative Leader in Virtualization and  Cloud Computing SoftwareVMware is a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility.

As maintenance on the Service Net application became a drain on time and human resources, VWGoA began to evaluate new options that would streamline processes, better manage content, and allow its staff to communicate and collaborate.After some assessment of their needs, VWGoA evaluated nine portal products, most of which seemed to provide the desired functionality. Among others, a well-known enterprise WCM solution was proposed, but the project was ultimately canceled due to difficult technical issues and costly attempts to fix the problems.  FACTSLearn how Liferay Portal helped Volkswagen:\u2022\t Complete portal implementation in 10 months\u2022\tReduce content release time from days to minutes\u2022\tSignificantly reduce costs and time-to-publish\u2022\tDeliver long-awaited user interface\u2022\tAutomate content publishing process\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMRESOLUTIOnIn response, the VWGoA team turned to Liferay Portal, choosing it for its flexibility and diverse capabilities as a packaged solution, which included both social collaboration and content management on top of an enterprise portal framework. While previously evaluated products provided similar capabilities, the product was broken down into different fragments. Liferay Portal was procured as a singular product and installed as a single package. Users were impressed that a full suite of cutting-edge capabilities could still function as such a light and quick solution that did not depend too heavily on other infrastructure components. In fact, this allowed the new Service Net application to be designed and deployed in just three short months (including integration with IBM Webseal\/Tivoli Access Manager (TAM) for single sign-on), a major success for the VWGoA team. \u201cThe project was able to meet all business requirements,\u201d said Sean Kramer, IT Manager at VWGoA. \u201cThe usability, look and feel of the interface were dramatically improved and incited renewed interest in the site.\u201d Notably, Liferay Portal\u2019s configuration of content and collaboration tools had a direct influence on how the Service Net application would be redesigned, with its new user interface and functionality now aligned with Liferay\u2019s. This made an immediate impact on usability, allowing users to navigate through the site with ease and improved taxonomy of information. There were also significant improvements in process: publishing times for new content were reduced from hours to minutes, and business users were able to publish documents on their own using Liferay\u2019s built-in workflow. The new search also allowed users to locate documents with greater efficiency and identify newly posted documents thanks to a \u201cWhat\u2019s New?\u201d feed displayed in the interface. What\u2019s more, since Liferay automated much of the workflow and other processes, VWGoA was able to save majorly on its spendings. \u201cLiferay Portal 6.0 EE has been a great success for us,\u201d added Kramer. \u201cWe plan on taking advantage of the many capabilities that Liferay will have to offer in the future.\u201d090111\u201cThe project was able to meet all business requirements.

Motivated by their faith in Jesus Christ, World Vision serves alongside the poor and oppressed as a demonstration of God\u2019s unconditional love for all people. World Vision serves all people, regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender.World Vision provides emergency and hunger relief, long-term community development programs, agricultural development assistance, and leadership training. The organization also educates the public on poverty- and justice-related issues, and advocates on behalf of the poor and children in crisis.ChALLEngEWorld Vision United States\u2019 International Programs Group (IPG), located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the management of grants, projects, and community development programs across the globe. As these teams of IPG workers required regular interfacing with fundraising headquarters in the United States and with one another, the operations of each local project hinged upon access to dependable and fluid means of communication. Unfortunately, basic e-mail drove 85% to 90% of all communication, and the lack of more dynamic collaboration tools quickly became an issue.IPG needed a technology that would pull together sets of data and human resources in  a way that would be easy to understand and manage. Beyond IPG, there were thousands of other employees for whom communication was crucial. For example, 1,400 Area Development Programs (ADPs) around the world necessitated constant and secure exchange of financial and logistical data. A number of privately funded projects were also in need of a more sophisticated means of sharing information categorized by region, purpose, or activity. Taking all these needs into account, World Vision drafted a list of criteria. \u201cToday, 85% of our informa-tion assets are accessible through Liferay Portal in a number of ways. It\u2019s really revolutionized the way that we communicate.\u201dWayne nIssLy,Strategic Capabilities, International Programs Group\fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMKey requirements included:\u2022\tContent management and data retrieval \u2013 World Vision had disparate sets of data in various forms from its many programs all over the world.\u2022\tIntuitive UI \u2013 The technology had to be easy to use for all of World Vision\u2019s staff, which represented a wide range of technical experience. \u2022\tsimple administrative maintenance \u2013 The technology had to be easy to maintain in the long run for the international non-profit.\u2022\tFlexible and adaptable technology \u2013 The technology had to be easy to integrate with the organization\u2019s existing IT as well as provide the flexibility of working with other applications as needed in the future.RESOLUTIOnA number of portal solutions were evaluated, including IBM WebSphere, Sharepoint, eXo, Uportal, and Jetspeed. While cost savings made the open source products very attractive, World Vision IPG ultimately chose Liferay Portal for the flexibility of its architecture, award-win-ning UI, ease of maintenance, and system interoperability.In particular, ease of integration with other technologies played a major part in its selection. As the operations model revolved around supporting collaboration efforts with real-time access to online information, integration with Oracle Universal Content Management (formerly Stellent) for enterprise content manage-ment was key to the project. Thanks to Liferay Portal\u2019s flexible framework, system integrator S & K Ventures painlessly implemented custom Oracle UCM portlets into Liferay that allowed portal users to see and edit documents focused on their areas of interest. Typical user-specific information was exposed, such as lists of documents currently being edited and lists of items waiting in the user workflow queue. It also leveraged other Oracle UCM functionality that allowed for lists of documents and document collabora-tion folders to be filtered based on user interest or the information\u2019s relevance to that particular community. World Vision also integrated ESRI\u2019s ArcIMS technology to provide maps that change dynamically based on user input and also enable navi-gation by geography and searching based on geographically-specific information.The resulting product was Knowledge Space, a collaboration portal with tools for workflows, alerts, and discussion around documents and dynamic mapping tools. Today, not only do these things far exceed the capabilities of e-mail, they revolu-tionized World Vision\u2019s entire system of communication, empowering its global community of humanitarian workers to better serve their communities. In an emergency response situation, for example, each emergency site assessment team has the power to enter and edit data for which they are specifically responsible. This data is then automatically updated on a map, providing immediate feedback and real-time access to online data to colleagues across the world. Hence, the portal was also able to introduce World Vision\u2019s many geographically dispersed teams to a greater sense of ownership and connection to the larger organization. \u201cLiferay Portal has really revolutionized the way that we are able to communicate with each other and the world,\u201d said Wayne Nissly, Strategic Capabilities, International Programs Group. \u201cIt has been and will continue to be an integral tool for stream-lining and advancing our operations and mission statement!\u201dLooking forward, World Vision plans to write custom portlets and applications within Liferay Portal to raise the level of interactivity that users have with maps and allow them to run reports and queries. World Vision also plans on incorporating Liferay\u2019s system of communities and social networking features into a donor-facing site that offers videos and media for financial donors to see and more tangibly relate to the communities that they are contributing to.TEChnOLOgY SpOTLIghT: STELLEnT InTEgRATIOnThe integration of Liferay with Oracle UCM was accomplished with standard JSR-168 portlets that remotely called a standard Oracle UCM socket-based API. For the API connection, a custom java client was used, built to be lightweight and to avoid dependency on a separate Oracle UCM library that was not at that point freely available. This API allowed World Vision to execute Oracle UCM service calls in the security context of the current portal user without having to present their password as a SOAP\/Web Services integration would have required. The Oracle UCM architecture around service definitions made the integration fairly straight forward\u2014all actions and data available in the UI can also be exposed via Portlets.061411\f"},{"filename":"YORK CASE STUDY - LONG.pdf","text":"LIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMhttp:\/\/my.yorku.caYork UniversityMy.Yorku.caFounded in 1959, York University is now Canada\u2019s third largest university, and world renowned for attracting students who forge their own unique paths to success.

Steiger and his team at Zaplive Media GmbH outlined some key criteria:\u2022\tCompelling look & feel: In order to attract the desired interest and activity, the site had to be visually compelling and easy to set up.\u2022\tStandards compliance: Given the innovative and interactive nature of the project,  the team needed a platform that would easily integrate many other technologies and provide fluid connections to the world. \u2022\tCollaboration: The team envisioned the site as a virtual community of sorts and knew that they wanted to include Web 2.0 collaboration tools (wikis, blogs, message boards, chat, etc.) to facilitate communication and activity.\u2022\tScalability and long-term viability: zaplive.tv was looking for a scalable solution that \fLIFERAY CASE STUDYWWW.LIFERAY.COMwould be maintainable in the long runrosoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS 7) interface or the ACM Collaboration Portal, a full-featured portal platform tailored for case management and powered by EMC Documentum and Liferay Portal that taps into Liferay\u2019s built in collaborative offerings.RESOLUTIOnA range of portal options were evaluated to host the site (ZOPE, PHP, .Net-Frameworks) before Liferay Portal was selected for its stability, developer-friendliness and performance. The openness of Liferay\u2019s platform allowed for easy customization and development of new tools. Ready integration with leading UI technologies like ICEfaces and jQuery also provided a basis for creating a dynamic and attractive product. Moreover, Liferay\u2019s adherence to industry standards (JSR-268, Hibernate, WSRP) and use of web services provided the easy integration and fluid connection to the \u201cworld\u201d that zaplive.tv required. \u201cThe architecture is state of the art and we think it will fit our needs for the future,\u201d said Steiger.The end product is zaplive.tv, a portal that allows any user to stream his or her own live broadcasts via the internet. All they need is a camcorder or a webcam, web access or simply a cellphone. zaplive.tv is not only live but also interactive with collaboration tools including live chat, and message boards and  blogs that allow for ratings and comments on single broadcasts.TEChnOLOgYThe zaplive.tv application is based on a clustered Tomcat 5.5 environment with a MySql 5 database server, an \u201cOpenfire\u201d chat server, and a \u201cWowza Media Server\u201d. Load balancing is managed by Apache 2 and mod_jk.In addition to Liferay\u2019s database schema, which is used to store the portal information like journal content, user and addresses, etc., an additional schema was created to store the broadcast information. The Liferay schema data is accessed by Liferay services. To access the data of the additional schema, JPA\/Hibernate is used.Community portlets are based on the standard Liferay portlets. Portlets displaying and handling broadcast are implemented with JSF \/ MyFaces, shale remoting and jQuery. The interaction between the Flash movies, streaming server and portal server is done by WebService calls (Apache Axis).The \u201czaplive.tv broadcaster\u201d mobile client is a Symbian Application, programmed in C++.  The mobile streams are fully integrated into the portal application, using WebService calls  and portal components.061411\f"}]
