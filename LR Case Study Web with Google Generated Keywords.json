The solution would have to meet the demand for a seamless, omnichannel experience. The UMS users were expecting to log in and access content at any time, anywhere, so this meant a platform that embraced delivery on mobile devices. Moreover, the team had to account for multiple campuses and various audiences within each ranging from applicants to active students and alumni as well as staff, faculty, and administrative divisions and departments.     The solution also had to meet high standards of usability (including adhering to universal design and standards such as WCAG 2.0 and WebAIM) and accessibility for vastly diverse groups of people while keeping up with current trends like responsive design.   Searching for the Right Platform     The organization decided to reconsider their solution from the ground up. Liferay\u2019s Enterprise Subscription was selected based on its long history as open source software, stability, wide range of features, extensibility and enterprise-level support.         The selection of Liferay\u2019s Enterprise Edition meant the Web Technologies team could hit the ground running, but the project was far from a direct upgrade. The existing portal had a great deal of content and data to be migrated, legacy applications that needed significant updates, customizations that would be critical in the new system, and new user stories to develop. Altogether, it was projected as a 20-month effort within management\u2019s comfort level.         As Liferay Enterprise subscribers, UMS was entitled to Liferay Support. During the project, Liferay engineers helped resolve many issues and assisted with the challenging task of data migration. In the end, the new platform debuted in less than 18 months, at least two months ahead of schedule.     Delivering a Modern Portal for an Ever-Changing Population     In June 2015, UMS performed a massive roll out to their campus audiences. The release featured a statewide implementation embracing the one-university, multi-campus concept. Many centralized services such as IT, HR and Procurement are located in the shared \u201cUMS\u201d site, while the campus-branded intranet sites are where most students, staff and faculty land after login. Other enterprise systems such as the UMS ERP (PeopleSoft) and the learning management system (currently Blackboard) are also centralized.         All campus stakeholders log into a common portal instance, yet remain affiliated with any campus with which they are actively engaged. Admitted and active students, alumni, staff and faculty all benefit from a campus portal that provides timely and relevant information across all channels.         The newly upgraded site utilizes Liferay\u2019s out-of-the-box responsive design features, allowing students and faculty to quickly access their information regardless of location or device. The average page load time has decreased by more than 33%, and their evening usage has seen an increase of mobile device traffic, in just a few months and is continually growing.         New sites are popping up to replace or supplement old programs and increase cost savings. Two examples include the Supervisor Development Institute and Title IX Training projects. They were both able to set up a site and mount all of their training materials online instead of having to pay for massive printed binders.     A Responsive, Omnichannel Multi-Campus Solution     The new site is modernized with greater agility and better usability across multiple channels, and boasts nine new themes and features including:           Custom plugins that display class and advisee lists to faculty, including student photos, downloadable\/printable lists      Custom LDAP user import and authorization routines      CAS SSO integration      Primary campus site landing page configuration and management      Responsive layout templates      Category links,a custom portlet with 250+ role-protected, categorized applications links, including SSOs to many conscripted resources         With this new platform in place, built with an eye on their users\u2019 evolving needs, UMS is positioned for success to serve graduating classes many years to come.","keywords":["open source project","University of Maine System","Web Technologies team","campus portal","platform","students","needs","Liferay","vision","innovation","Enterprise Subscription","team","solution","mobile devices","content","customizations","demand","experience","anywhere","delivery","users","campus","organization","legacy applications","release","Blackboard","campuses","solution","faculty","Platform","students","staff","applicants","design","groups","design","ground","solution","engineers","alumni","audiences","accessibility","people","standards","usability","standards","portal","project","divisions","departments","trends","site","Portal","evolving needs","intranet sites","UMS","project","platform","system","students","faculty","management","features","team","enterprise systems","staff","comfort level","subscribers","campus audiences","support","data","content","campus portal","sites","site","site","land","instance","effort","data migration","task","schedule","end","roll","history","open source software","stability","range","extensibility","upgrade","ground running","deal","user stories","projects","all","concept","login","Procurement","IT","services","campus stakeholders","issues","WCAG 2.0","WebAIM","features","implementation","selection","updates","Liferay Enterprise","examples","channels","usability","plugins","programs","cost savings","binders","training materials","agility","themes","portlet","faculty","Liferay Support","Web Technologies","user","platform","users","PeopleSoft","applications","management","Ever-Changing Population","Enterprise Edition","advisee lists","class","links","classes","lists","links","Omnichannel Multi-Campus Solution","Responsive","HR","UMS ERP","eye","resources","import","authorization routines","integration","Primary campus site landing page configuration","layout templates","success","place","site","Supervisor Development Institute and Title IX Training","faculty","faculty","staff","device","design features","alumni","channels","information","page","student photos","benefit","location","mobile device traffic","increase","evening usage","LDAP","CAS SSO","information","SSOs"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=imrb","text":"IMRB International is an established and trusted market research company with over 1,200 users and offices across 19 different countries.

Founded in 1824, the RSPCA successfully rescues, rehabilitates and rehomes hundreds of thousands of animals every year in England and Wales. The charity also provides information and advice on caring for animals, and campaigns to change laws that will protect them. The RSPCA receives no government funding and relies primarily on a donor base of 500,000 supporters, whose donations exceed \u00a3100 million annually. Employing over 1600 staff, the wide scope of the RSPCA's work includes its inspectorate, animal centres and clinics, legal prosecutions and support for volunteer-led branches across the UK.   Challenge     As a well-established and growing organisation, the RSPCA recognised their technology needed to adapt accordingly. Communication was evolving to be more dynamic and collaborative, and historical methods of presenting information across a one way channel were very much out of date. The existing content management system was complex, and business processes were slowed down by technical limitations. New developments formed a bottleneck in the IT unit so the business community was unable to react quickly to changing requirements.     The new priority was to engage with the public in ways they wanted and expected. A fresh approach was taken to creating an online experience built around the user journey which would increase traffic, deepen engagement and encourage return visits. Employees and the branch network also needed better ways to collaborate and share valuable content. The right solution would empower the RSPCA with business agility and great opportunity for innovation and income generation.     Resolution     In 2010 the RSPCA adopted Liferay initially for the public website, based on the platform's rich user experience and its integration and extension capabilities. Several microsites were created to meet the demand of multiple business users, enabling them to easily set up and manage their own campaigns. The users were then able to generate local content which would be visible on the main website, increasing exposure and value.     With a successful public facing website in place, the RSPCA added more features month by month. One of Liferay's most valuable aspects is that features can be built on the foundations of previous development, so that the organisation is constantly adding value to its platform. They now have responsive design through the entire website and all their microsites are scalable to desktop, tablets, mobile and more. This year after this development was completed, over half of their visits came from mobile devices, markedly improving accessibility and overall engagement.     As the organisation grew and matured, Liferay was able to scale according to their needs. The RSPCA has now started a new branch extranet system, which is used by their branch network so they can manage the data for the animals they care for and create microsite content locally.     Business Value Added     The RSPCA's ability to deliver has improved significantly. Development can now be done in a matter of days rather than months, so cost and time to market have been drastically reduced. New functionalities are added to the toolkit every month. Better internal engagement has led to better sites and more effective relationships with employees, branches and supporters overall. Business units are now empowered to react immediately to changing requirements, which has a clear impact on income as campaign awareness and donations increase accordingly.     There are several planned extensions of the Liferay platform, including the supporter portal, My RSPCA. My RSPCA currently provides a secure communication channel for enquiries, newsletters and other information. There are thousands of registered users, and plans for future releases to get even better value out of Liferay include user-generated content, forums and greater overall public engagement.","keywords":["Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals","supporters","laws","Liferay","world","animals","animals","business users","campaigns","organisation","thousands","charity","government funding","content","hundreds","advice","donor base","information","development","value","user journey","Wales","England","branches","support","engagement","Communication","information","methods","scope","donations","channel","content","requirements","Development","Challenge","work","staff","inspectorate","prosecutions","animal centres","clinics","technology","way","business community","website","developments","engagement","content management system","One","platform","website","value","website","Business Value","campaigns","organisation","platform","Employees","branch network","income","user experience","extension","IT unit","requirements","ways","experience","priority","microsites","features","solution","business agility","opportunity","innovation","generation","integration","capabilities","Resolution","demand","business processes","limitations","bottleneck","public","traffic","approach","microsite content","branches","ways","supporters","exposure","place","aspects","foundations","design","UK","return visits","value","employees","Business units","My RSPCA","users","ability","matter","cost","market","functionalities","toolkit","sites","relationships","content","engagement","users","platform","information","organisation","plans","income","donations","extensions","thousands","impact","campaign awareness","enquiries","newsletters","releases","forums","animals","communication channel","website","engagement","microsites","half","more","visits","branch extranet system","branch network","tablets","desktop","accessibility","mobile devices","needs","data"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=knowledge-hub","text":"Knowledge Hub is the UK\u2019s leading digital collaboration space for the public sector.

Partners\u2019 interactions with HP were dispersed across several disjointed portal experiences, scores of online tools, and all with different login steps.     To make matters worse, about 3,000 worldwide content owners from across the company were publishing to the various sites with few controls in place. Pages displayed up to 20 information links at a time. Further, an audit found that nearly 80 percent of the content was more than a year old.   Taking an outside-in approach     Anderson and her extended team determined they also needed to radically change their approach from \u2018inside-out\u2019 to \u2018outside-in.\u2019 They sought extensive feedback from HP\u2019s partners and, armed with 10,000 survey comments, input from partner forums, and best practice advice from portal experts, decided they needed to invest in a new portal technology that could handle the complexity of:           3,000 content providers      650,000 users across 174 countries in 25 languages      Diverse business units with millions of HP products      A multi-tiered channel program      Radically different types of partner businesses      Variety of user roles among partners      Global, 24x7 operations          A single global entry point     Using Liferay as the underlying platform, and for the first time in company history, HP was able to offer all its partners a single global URL and entry point to all of the services and tools available within the partner ecosystem: including a catalog of products, deal registration, order management, quoting and compensation, training and marketing support. Additionally, a customizable dashboard allows users to self-configure the business tools they use most to their homepage for rapid, 1-click access.         Through the new HP Partner Portal, partners were able to receive content in a targeted and relevant way through a multi-level set of permissions to deliver meaningful news, promos, homepage content, notifications, banners and more.         The key features and benefits of the HP Unison Partner Portal included:           One partner portal with a global URL and single login to the entire HP partner ecosystem.      Navigation organized by partner task rather than HP business structure.      Clean, clear, consistent structure and search for easy-to-find content.      Quick access to tools: one-click away from content and applications through customizable homepage dashboard.      Improved performance using HP Moonshot Servers, customized      Liferay extensions and real-time monitoring worldwide for rapid response to issues.          The results     Following the company separation in 2015, part of the HP Unison Partner Portal became the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Partner Ready Portal. In addition, HPE has completed eight different acquisitions and two divestitures that required integration with numerous different assets within the Portal environment.

Overcoming all existing barriers and limitations to the production of grain, meat and other kinds of food supplies, Embrapa has been the driving force behind this segment in Brazil, bringing efficiency to its agriculture, livestock and grain production. It was responsible for increasing the productivity of beef and pork in over 22 times the previous number, while also creating a way to turn the acidic lands of the Cerrado into fertile ground.   Today, Brazil figures among the world\u2019s main producers and exporters. Embrapa currently has over 9,500 collaborators, 46 research centers spread across all of Brazil\u2019s regions, and offices and international cooperation programs in Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia.   The Challenge     Embrapa wanted to modernize and systematize the way they presented content to the public. The first iterations of the Embrapa Portal were built of independent structures, developed by different technologies, hosted separately and with no interoperability. These factors would result in the repetition of content and lack of uniformity concerning interfaces, features and structure. The biggest challenges were to integrate all the data from the different units into a single unified platform, perfecting the content recovery interface, and building a more organized portal, one that matched the company\u2019s status.     With that in mind, the company\u2019s IT Department performed an evaluation of five open source CMS (Content Management Systems). The evaluation included criteria such as security, the ability to integrate multiple databases, how easily the teams would adapt to it, how well it could set up processes and support the level of cooperation between the company\u2019s employees. Liferay was chosen after being considered the best among the five systems.     To work on this project, the company made use the Liferay Training Programs: the Portal Administrator Training, the System Administrator Training and the Developer Training.     The Solution     The new Liferay Portal, developed through a partnership with SEA Technology, was able to set new standards for Embrapa\u2019s management of web content. Today, clear patterns have been established for the insertion, categorization and management of every different kind of content, all thanks to the integration of these previously successful business management models and systems. Integrating the databases to the Liferay Portal resulted in a sharp decrease of content repetition and helped enhance code reutilization processes and collaborative work between multiple teams.     These changes granted citizens easier access to Embrapa\u2019s information, such as free-of-charge content download availability, up-to-date information, interactive product catalogs and a portfolio for research projects. The BDPA - Agriculture Research Database (Embrapa\u2019s archive of technical and scientific studies) was also greatly benefited by the new portal, taking into consideration its monthly access numbers rose from the previous 271,019 to over 1 million. Numbers are a clear indicator that the new portal was able to provide citizens with an improved way of accessing Embrapa\u2019s digital archives.     The access indicators show how beneficial the changes were. In August, the portal presented a 124% increase in its number of page views when compared to the same month in the previous year, and the average time spent by users on the website was also greatly improved, going from 2 minutes and 52 seconds to a new mark of 4 minutes and 11 seconds.     In 2014, the Embrapa portal was the best evaluated portal among Latin American research centers, as verified by the Ranking Web of World Research Centers. Embrapa took the 24th spot in the world evaluation, and the 11th spot when comparing American research centers \u2014 topped only by United States foundations. Among the world\u2019s agriculture research centers, Embrapa figures as the second best, behind only the Institut National de la Recherche Agr\u00edcole (INRA), from France.

Challenge     In 2010, the ENEM required INEP to implement a new portal. The INEP's portal was entirely developed in HTML and there lacked a content migration tool. Press and web professionals were forced to assign content updating and maintenance to infrastructure professionals. Due to the lack of a migration tool, all editing had to be performed manually by the press and further adjustments were done by the Infra. In addition, the period of enrollment accessibility threatened the stability of the sit during the peak of the load.     Resolution     To address these problems, the ENEM required a portal that provided ease in administration in its straightforward approach to content management. HTML structure was abandoned and all website content was moved to Liferay, which facilitated the work of the press without requiring further help of infrastructure professionals for content management. Liferay was also able to securely support the overload of enrollments for the ENEM. To further maximize efficiency, an information architecture was implemented by SEA to modernize the portal and offer greater functionality and accessibility to ENEM.     Renewal should be made in accordance with the standards of the Ministry of the Education and Culture: In terms of functionality and infrastructure, the modernization of the INEP's portal improved the integration between the three major areas of Infrastructure, Communication and Development. Through Liferay, content management was decentralized, simplifying execution and exempting workers from specific knowledge. The migration also excelled the standards established by MEC, managing to unite the functionality and the modernization to them. Despite the overflow of millions of enrollments, the new portal is fully supported and only two machines were deployed, reducing the number of machines used beforehand.     \"From a technical point of view, we recovered the security and the infrastructure.

Today, ISAC has two main priorities: Make college accessible and affordable for Illinois students, and increase the proportion of adults with a postsecondary credential to 60% by 2025. User-centric services are key to ISAC's vision, whether they're designing processes for students and families, the 140 colleges and universities it partners with, or its own internal business users.   \"We had an existing system, but it was very siloed,\" said Kalaiselvan Sambasivan, Application Development Manager.   Authentication, authorization and business logic were spread out and repeated across core applications. This resulted in increased complexity for the business process, a poor customer experience for ISAC\u2019s partners and a high maintenance cost.   ISAC decided to re-engineer the Gift Assistance Program (GAP) Access Portal so that its business users and partners could easily see data and track the status of financial aid processes. In order to move all processes off of the old technology in a cost-efficient way, it needed a solution that was robust, scalable and reliable, with tools to cater to multiple audiences, manage complicated data systems and reduce the dependency of business users on IT. It was imperative that the solution be flexible, as new regulatory mandates required ISAC\u2019s IT team to quickly modify programming within strict timelines.   Developing a Unified Solution to Aggregate Student Data and Streamline Reporting     Based on a Gartner report, ISAC chose Liferay as an open source solution that satisfied all functionality, scalability, reliability and total cost of ownership requirements. With Liferay, ISAC was able to consolidate all of its student and partner data in GAP Access so that its business users could easily view or run reports in real time. The flexibility of the platform also meant that business users could request changes with the confidence that the IT team would be able to deliver within their timeframe 98% of the time. The new solution provides visibility into the data for all business units (where it was previously limited to program services and compliance), including accounting and the college outreach team. Now every department can see and run its own reports without going through the IT team.     In addition, ISAC manages an annual budget submission review from the 140 colleges and universities with which it partners. The agency used Liferay to digitize the process, changing it from a series of paper-based steps to a completely digital solution. Instead of tracking mailed applications and reviewing hand-written submissions, ISAC can now view the most current versions of budget submissions online through GAP Access. Partners are also free to change their information as needed, for instance if demographics change or a new campus needs to be added.     One unanticipated benefit that ISAC found after switching to Liferay was a simplified process for securely transmitting sensitive student data. Schools used to spend hours encrypting data and transmitting it across multiple systems in order to update student information. With all of the data integrated into GAP Access, schools can now view everything in one spot. They can also track students and filter them based on specific criteria. All of ISAC's programs are visible in one portal as well, available through a single sign in, whereas sites for each program used to be far flung and require users to log in multiple times.     When it expanded its use of Liferay to its student portal, ISAC made it possible to maintain consistent experiences for students. Once students make an account, they can pick up where they left off with filling out financial aid worksheets, comparing schools or other activities. The portal also features interactive games and a modern, mobile-friendly design to better appeal to students.     Building a Platform for Future Collaboration     Having a unified platform empowers ISAC's business users to administer processes without involving IT. They are able to confidently meet deadlines for new requirements, which they couldn't do easily with the previous system. This has freed IT to support other Illinois agencies and pursue a new collaborative effort with the Illinois Department of Employment Security, Illinois State University and the Illinois Board of Higher Education. ISAC is providing the data for the collaborative team to look at trends for graduation rates and job expectancy rates for its students. They want to answer questions such as, When a student goes into a particular program, what kind of growth can she expect to see? The hope is that, down the road, this project will provide even more benefits for Illinois students.     \"GAP Access will give partners access to every program ISAC has to offer,\" said David Perry, Assistant Director of Partner and Product Services. Liferay has provided a platform for IT and business to work hand in hand as ISAC continues its digital transformation for the benefit of students across the state.","keywords":["Illinois Student Assistance Commission","students","colleges","universities","state lawmakers","Illinois","system","services","benefit","IT","GAP Access","considerations","goals","students","business users","all","business users","business users","processes","IT team","Liferay","college","vision","credential","adults","proportion","priorities","families","student","business units","Partners","Kalaiselvan Sambasivan","business users","data","portal","requirements","business process","aid processes","processes","partners","partners","student","status","Access Portal","solution","mandates","applications","customer experience","maintenance cost","solution","deadlines","Authentication","authorization","complexity","order","data","data","students","business users","process","students","programming","Platform","student data","data","solution","business logic","open source solution","Solution","partner","tools","way","technology","college outreach team","timelines","students","solution","Gift Assistance Program","platform","data systems","report","Reporting","program services","universities","GAP","cost","systems","budget submissions","applications","Schools","compliance","agency","ownership requirements","processes","information","student information","order","confidence","budget submission review","addition","David Perry","audiences","dependency","scalability","reliability","functionality","Streamline","Collaboration","students","students","submissions","team","demographics","platform","system","steps","series","versions","instance","campus","data","hand in hand","visibility","flexibility","business","agencies","reports","reports","accounting","program","program","partners","account","IT team","activities","design","appeal","effort","trends","state","department","games","students","Product Services","benefit","Gartner","Aggregate Student Data","hope","job expectancy rates","graduation rates","access","kind","Illinois State University","data","changes","platform","growth","questions","project","road","transformation","program","programs","Department of Employment Security","benefits","All","times","schools","Illinois Board of Higher Education","portal","student portal","schools","experiences","aid","spot","everything","criteria","sites","sign","use","worksheets","users"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=iplanrio-carioca-digital-","text":"IPLANRIO is the company responsible for providing Rio de Janeiro\u2019s municipal services - such as municipalities, government-owned corporations and foundations - with services in the areas of Information Technology and Communication. It is responsible for meeting the needs of over 6 million citizens.   Challenge     Rio de Janeiro\u2019s municipal government was searching for a way of modernizing its admistrative system and improving the way its public services were presented to its inhabitants. Among the project\u2019s imperative needs were those of increasing the communication with its final users and improving the management of open information. IPLANRIO also had the mission of building a platform to better interact with its target audience, presenting the practicality of the tools found in an internet banking system, as a way of providing citizens with highly efficient public services.     Solution     The \u201cCarioca Digital\u201d was created: a platform for interacting with citizens from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Vertigo Technology, an official Liferay partner, developed the project from its conception. Some of its activities included the implementation of a high-availability cluster; setting up, updating and creating new features; providing support, performance management and tunning, aimed at maximizing network efficiency and security; and providing consultancy services related to interface design. Concerning the design pattern, the project was based on a service-orienteded architecture, and culminated in the creation of the RUC (Citizen Unified Registry), which employs an enterprise service bus, taking data from many different repositories.     Therefore, it consists of an unified access platform. The \u201cCarioca Digital\u201d provides the citizens with an integrated way of checking their SUS medical records, verifying their fines, taxes, cultural activities, invoices from the Nota Fiscal Carioca system, and contacting the government through the Central de Atendimento ao Cidad\u00e3o 1746 system. Through the portal, a public participation management model is established, with the citizens taking part in polls regarding which citizen service channels should be incorporated to the system next.     The Government values being close to its target audience, as is defined by the concept of audience engagement. As a result, the number of monthly accesses to Municipal Government data, as well as its users\u2019 satisfaction towards the service, has seen a significant increase.","keywords":["IPLANRIO","services","company","services","municipalities","corporations","foundations","areas","Vertigo Technology","government","citizens","target audience","Information Technology and Communication","government","Rio de Janeiro","project","needs","Challenge","RUC","Carioca Digital","services","admistrative system","platform","way","way","polls","management","information","users","communication","needs","services","citizens","citizens","inhabitants","citizens","internet banking system","way","partner","project","platform","satisfaction","citizens","consultancy services","Some","performance management","project","conception","activities","interface design","city","features","cluster","implementation","part","practicality","tools","mission","system","system","system","tunning","network efficiency","security","design pattern","architecture","creation","service","support","citizen service channels","portal","participation management model","Municipal Government","Liferay","concept","data","users","accesses","Citizen Unified Registry","Nota Fiscal Carioca","values","audience engagement","result","number","increase","Cidad\u00e3o 1746","Central de Atendimento","way","data","access platform","activities","repositories","enterprise service bus","invoices","taxes","fines","records","SUS"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=nsw-department-of-education","text":"The NSW Department of Education (DoE) identified a need to provide a cost effective and simple method for public schools in NSW to set-up and manage an online presence. It also wanted to provide a way for each school to tailor the site to suit their specific needs and foster connection and engagement with the parents and carers of its students, the result is the School Website Service.   The School Website Service is available to all primary and secondary public schools in NSW and to date 2044 schools have a website (85% of all public schools in NSW).   In 2011 DoE engaged with Permeance Technologies, a Liferay Platinum Partner, and selected the Liferay platform on which to develop the School Website Service. This followed successful earlier implementations of both Staff and Student Portals for DoE by Permeance, also running on the Liferay platform.     Since the initial launch of the service the technology and original bespoke templates have evolved with the DoE School Website Service development team recently releasing a brand new responsive template for schools that use the service. For the schools using the new template it ensures they have a modern online presence by which to communicate relevant school activities to student\u2019s parents and their carers\u2019 while enjoying a seamless experience on any device.     Each School\u2019s site is a combination of DoE content such as curriculum and policies, and the School\u2019s own, including; newsletters, enrolment information, school news, photo and videos galleries and calendars. The sites can also integrate payments functionality, social media such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Blogs which have been developed in-house by the DoE School Website Service development team on the Liferay platform. Keeping pace with today\u2019s most popular method of consuming information, online, ensures that the parents and carers of students are able to engage in a way that best suits their personal preferences.     Enabling public schools to shine online     The concept of the School Website Service was developed by DoE (formerly Department of Education and Communities, DEC) in 2011 in collaboration with the NSW Secondary Principals\u2019 Council and the NSW Primary Principals\u2019 Association and continues to receive widespread support and praise for the ease of use and professional appearance of each website.     After launching in 2011 Lila Mularczyk, then Deputy President of NSW Secondary Principals\u2019 Council and Principal, Merrylands High School, was one of the first to offer congratulations, \u201cAbsolutely fantastic service, the best advocacy we have seen for public education in my working career,\u201d she said.     The ability to establish and manage a digital presence easily and quickly is seen as a way for all public schools in NSW to establish a professional online presence in an increasingly competitive environment. Parents and carers of children spend lots of time weighing up which is the best school to care for the education of their children. With an online presence the schools are well placed to convey their points of difference and values in a professional and relevant way.     \u201cWhen choosing schools for their children parents do visit websites and if you\u2019ve got a nice, colourful website that showcases all your different programs and achievements it\u2019s going to help,\u201d said Deputy Principal of Birrong Boys High, Angelo Stasos. \u201cFor schools to be able to so easily design and manage the website is a golden opportunity.\u201d     User experience at the centre of responsive design     \u201cA great user experience is so important when people engage online so we\u2019re really pleased that Liferay has been able to help New South Wales public schools deliver modern websites that look great on any device and provide important information to the community,\u201d said Adrian Johnson, General Manager, Liferay Australia.     The flexibility of the Liferay platform has enabled the School Website Service development team at DoE to quickly and easily customise themes and templates to suit the needs of the program. For the initial launch of the Schools Website Service an agile approach to development was undertaken and now the Program team follows a standard set of release dates and provides ongoing support to users.     \u201cThe School Website Service has evolved over the years based on the development team undertaking ongoing research and development with NSW schools and the broader community which has led to many improvements being incorporated as new technology has become available,\" said Oscar Cortez, Program Manager, School Website Service, NSW Department of Education.     Each school pays a nominal fee for a website which includes hosting and support. Using a website builder wizard schools can then construct a website which enables them to select colours, formats, plus and content menus and then tailor it to their specific needs and those of their school community.","keywords":["NSW","School Website Service","NSW Department of Education","schools","needs","platform","school","parents","Liferay Platinum Partner","presence","Deputy President","need","schools","schools","schools","DoE","cost","set-up","website","method","schools","website","combination","schools","carers","school","presence","students","site","result","way","connection","engagement","parents","way","Parents","children","website","schools","School Website Service","service","service","payments functionality","DoE","schools","website","template","templates","website","development team","service","template","in-house","technology","launch","DoE School Website Service","parents","Student Portals","Staff","implementations","websites","carers","Principal","carers","development team","support","presence","presence","students","student","education","working career","carers","education","presence","Schools Website Service","enrolment information","sites","information","way","experience","website builder wizard schools","schools","ability","children","device","content","school news","method","school","Permeance Technologies","DoE School Website Service","flexibility","development","preferences","appearance","use","ease","praise","collaboration","concept","Permeance","school activities","galleries","curriculum","policies","calendars","videos","photo","Blogs","social media","community","templates","needs","program","schools","first","advocacy","environment","lots","pace","Angelo Stasos","School Website Service","congratulations","schools","users","development team","websites","General Manager","device","launch","NSW Secondary Principals' Council","The School Website Service","newsletters","development","themes","approach","development team","set","information","support","community","school community","team","website","technology","support","NSW Primary Principals' Association","DEC","Lila Mularczyk","YouTube","Twitter","Facebook","Program Manager","Program","research","improvements","fee","content menus","plus","formats","User experience","Liferay Australia","way","opportunity","Adrian Johnson","user experience","colours","values","points","difference","achievements","people","design","centre","Oscar Cortez","programs","Birrong Boys High"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=editora-moderna","text":"Present in more than 22 countries, Grupo Santillana is one of Spain\u2019s largest publishers. The Spanish organization, established in 1960, started operating in Brazil in 2001 when it acquired Editora Moderna. This Brazilian publisher, a leader in the educational book segment for the public and private school systems, boasts a more than 40-year history of commitment to education in the country. In addition to books aimed at early, elementary and high school education, the group publishes foreign language learning titles and fiction.   Editora Moderna\u2019s mission is to find innovative ways to produce, edit and publish material that significantly contributes to improving Brazilian education and giving teachers and students well-rounded educations. Today, its website offers apps, a teachers\u2019 portal and downloadable books. The company invests in research that ensures it creates effective tools for its audience, a philosophy that is reflected in its slogan: Creating schools with you.   A Digital Strategy for True Transformation     For decades, companies believed that technology in and of itself was the solution to modernizing their businesses, and replicated cookie-cutter models to limited success. As time passed, companies learned that they needed to go beyond technology and rethink their business processes in transformative ways if they wanted to stay competitive in a digital economy.     For Editora Moderna, this meant finding new ways to transfer knowledge to students with different learning profiles, while increasing teacher engagement and making technology a fundamental part of the teaching process. The company\u2019s existing platform made it impossible to reach these targets. It needed to rethink its entire technology model so that it could meet requirements and integrate seamlessly with the current architecture.     The challenge was daunting; the company\u2019s planned time-to-market was short and, as a publisher, it had an extremely large volume of content to manage. On top of this, Moderna had many obstacles to overcome with its current systems, including problems integrating with legacy systems, a lack of qualified labor to handle proprietary technology, a dearth of developer partners and inadequate support, as well as difficulties updating the platform with new content.     A User-Centric Redesign That Doubled Mobile Visitors     Once these challenges were mapped, Moderna began to search for the most appropriate tool, ultimately choosing Liferay as the best fit. The Liferay platform met the following prerequisites:           Easy implementation and customization of mobile-ready sites      High capacity for integration, in keeping with the best practices on the market      Freedom and flexibility for internal teams      Consistent support      Ranked a Leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals      Available Learning Management System (LMS) plugin       Advanced consulting          After the selection process, Moderna needed to decide the best way to manage the transition of its entire portal to the Liferay solution. The planning required for this transition was made possible through a strategic alignment between Moderna, GM5 (the official partner) and the Liferay team.     The portal, named Moderna Plus, was redesigned with a focus on usability and performance. A new panel, with sections for Favorites and customized content for each user (for example, specific classes and groups per person), has improved engagement. Teachers and students are able to work on their tablets as part of a \u201cGo Mobile\u201d strategy and search is multifaceted, improving results from different educational titles.     Today, a partial move to the adopted solution has already been completed on six of the publisher\u2019s sites, including the Moderna Plus collection, and a new website has been developed for this new scenario. The benefits of switching to Liferay are very clear: page searches are better positioned, site visits are more frequent, and there is a higher number of users. Best of all, visits to the site from mobile devices have doubled, affirming that Editora Moderna has successfully found a way to serve its teachers and students in a modern way for the digital age.","keywords":["Editora Moderna","organization","technology","publishers","one","research","countries","Grupo Santillana","material","publisher","private school systems","education","high school education","books","Spain","companies","country","leader","group","commitment","history","book segment","addition","time-to-market","Redesign","philosophy","Editora","Liferay","website","ways","Teachers","Spanish","Brazil","teachers","teachers","companies","students","education","educations","ways","books","schools","company","technology model","models","mission","language learning titles","tools","fiction","portal","audience","slogan","apps","company","company","technology","technology","Learning Management System","publisher","systems","legacy systems","students","part","challenge","platform","content","ways","business processes","teaching process","developer partners","technology","platform","content","Visitors","platform","businesses","teacher engagement","website","support","tool","challenges","targets","architecture","requirements","volume","obstacles","top","success","economy","learning profiles","knowledge","search","students","part","publisher","difficulties","dearth","labor","lack","fit","prerequisites","integration","capacity","customization","implementation","visits","user","content","solution","engagement","groups","titles","strategy","teachers","performance","usability","focus","person","classes","example","Favorites","sections","panel","results","tablets","move","six","problems","Moderna Plus","sites","Best","students","site","users","way","way","Digital Strategy for True Transformation For","site visits","number","page searches","scenario","mobile devices","all","age","benefits","Go Mobile","partner","solution","portal","transition","way","selection process","Portals","transition","portal","planning","Leader","support","teams","team","Moderna Plus","collection","consulting","market Freedom","flexibility","best practices","alignment","Magic Quadrant","Gartner","GM5"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=intralot","text":"YourPlay is a Victorian State Government initiative, aimed at helping players to make informed decisions about their gaming machine use by allowing them to set limits on the time or money spent, and provides a live action summary on screen. The Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation, which advises on gambling policy and regulation, oversaw the development of the Pre-Commitment system on behalf of the Victorian State Government.   Intralot Australia's wholly owned subsidiary, Intralot Gaming Services Pty Ltd (IGS), was granted Victoria's single electronic gaming machine (EGM) Monitoring Licence for 15 years in 2011 by the Minister for Gaming. Intralot provides data and information on gaming machines for regulatory and taxation purposes, and ensures Venue Operator obligations for player fairness are being met.   Australia's first state wide pre-commitment scheme, YourPlay, is helping thousands track the money and time they spend using gaming machines across Victoria, and in the Melbourne casino. Of the 23,404 cards activated, 8130 have been registered and 15,274 are casual cards. Both cards allow users to limit their time and money, and track the total amount they spend on gaming machines anywhere in the state. More than 1730 users have set personalised messages to be displayed to them when they approach their playing limit.     \"The pre-commitment scheme is a first for Australia and the preliminary statistics are encouraging,\" said Minister for Consumer Affairs, Gaming and Liquor Regulation, Jane Garrett.     Australia's first networked pre-commitment scheme has delivered more than 2.5 million responsible gambling messages during 818,000 gaming machine sessions in its first six months.     User experience is a key factor in the success of YourPlay     Intralot chose Liferay as the platform to deliver the YourPlay player interface based on Intralot's experience internationally with Liferay. Liferay has proven system capabilities with a strong focus on the user experience. In addition, Intralot's team wanted a system that delivered: integration with multiple systems, data security, high availability, load balancing, device independence, ease of use, and the ability to manage hundreds of thousands of transactions concurrently.     Every YourPlay player transaction on every gaming machine across Victoria is captured and recorded by YourPlay which must integrate gaming and hardware systems, monitoring systems and in-venue kiosks in order ensure up to date and accurate information is available to players 24\/7.     \"The user experience, 100% up-time and seamless integration are critical to the success of YourPlay and its ability to play a part in reducing problem gambling. Liferay is critical to the successful delivery of the positive user experience, said Steve Uren, IT Manager, Intralot Gaming Services Pty Ltd.     To register, people can go to www.yourplay.com.au and enter as much or as little information as they like and it is personalised to individuals and encrypted for security purposes.     \"Many people who play gaming machines have a limit but they don't always stick to it. YourPlay helps people do that,\" said Minister Garrett.     A platform that enables user personalisation     YourPlay users can see live action summaries tracking the money and time they spend on a display screen at the gaming machine whilst they are playing. Those who've set limits get reminders before and when they reach a limit. Players can generate statements about their play over a day, a week, a month or a year - using the online systems or by logging in to their account at kiosks in venues - plus, players can receive an annual statement.     \"We genuinely don't think we would have got the same quality outcomes on any platform other than Liferay. We have received excellent support from the Liferay team during the project and after go-live with the delivery of everything that was promised. Once our team got hold of Liferay it was very quick to deliver YourPlay because Liferay is so intuitive to use and just works! We believe this pre-commitment scheme is a leading solution globally\" said Steve Uren.     The first of its kind in Australia the pre-commitment scheme is dedicated to harm minimisation in gambling and helping people affected by problem gambling as well as the wider community.     \"Liferay is dedicated to investing in communities and serving others so to play a part in bringing YourPlay to the community and contribute to helping people struggling with gambling is something we're really proud of.

Their immediate need was for a solution that would allow thousands of users around the world to search and download software, including files running into hundreds of megabytes.   Instead of settling for a narrow solution, Schneider seized the opportunity to reimagine their entire information hub. Their roadmap included a partner extranet, a key public website, a marketing collateral mobile app, and various software tools for their customers, partners, and employees around the world. To accomplish this, they needed a platform that was agile and flexible, bringing together an array of services in a way that was easy to manage.   A Versatile Platform to Meet All Needs     Liferay, a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, was chosen by Schneider Electric for its low total cost of ownership, business ability, and rich out-of-the-box functionality, including a strong content management system, identity management capabilities, ability to leverage a public cloud infrastructure, and extensibility as a development platform.     Schneider Electric chose XTIVIA, winner of Liferay\u2019s Partner of the Year award for three years in a row, for its proven leadership in the portal space and its ability to work with the E-Business team to implement its strategic vision.     A Modern User Experience     First, the team built an easy-to-navigate system and leveraged Liferay\u2019s AUI framework for a responsive theme. Custom responsive layouts provided a clean, professional, and consistent look and feel to the site, optimizing the user experience for mobile devices and tablets.     Next, XTIVIA used the workflow feature of Liferay for document and software package uploads and implemented an end-user oriented \u201cdocument search\u201d portlet that supported filters, continuous search results (infinite scroll), the ability to identify and show the related assets, and the ability to track searches and downloads. The XTIVIA team enhanced the core Liferay search capability with XTIVIA search innovations and a robust SolrCloud search infrastructure which greatly enhanced the performance of the search queries. XTIVIA also ensured that the Schneider E-Business staff were trained in managing and operating the portal on a day-to-day basis and had the ability to update the content as required to keep the site fresh.     To fortify security, the XTIVIA team implemented features that required users to be registered and verified before they had the ability to download assets from the Exchange system. The team also set up Single-Sign-On (SSO) between the Exchange system and multiple applications within the organization. Finally, XTIVIA worked with the Schneider E-Business team to redesign and rebuild the user interface of the Exchange site by adding key functionality improvements in the search and presentation of assets for their target audience.     XTIVIA also completed a project to integrate Schneider\u2019s mobile marketing platform with the Liferay platform to provide a conduit for assets to be available to the internal Sales and Marketing teams in a professional and aesthetically pleasing manner on their marketing platform.     Exceptional Customer Experience That Continues to Evolve     The Exchange was launched by the E-Business team in the first quarter of 2014, and it quickly became the go-to resource for Schneider Electric\u2019s partners and employees around the world. Schneider received rave reviews from its customers, affirming that the new platform is providing a dynamic and enjoyable user experience. Even their own staff see day-to-day advantages as the workflow and content management enabled by Liferay helps increase productivity for both portal management and internal marketing efforts.     Liferay continues to provide value to the Schneider E-Business team as a complete application development platform and not just a Content Management System. XTIVIA and Schneider Electric are working together as a team on additional Liferay-based projects to continually improve the current platform.","keywords":["Schneider Electric","platform","department","solution","Liferay","XTIVIA","needs","partner extranet","more","software download center","team","Customer Experience","platform","users","team","thousands","need","Buildings Business","team","software","world","roadmap","solution","partner extranet","way","Schneider","hundreds","information hub","opportunity","ability","software tools","portlet","search infrastructure","files","Platform","system","business ability","partners","customers","world","Needs","customers","development platform","employees","leader","features","document search","ability","end-user","ability","ability","XTIVIA","searches","website","marketing collateral","app","services","ownership","cost","system","ability","team","user experience","User Experience","array","site","content","workflow feature","marketing platform","teams","mobile marketing platform","platform","downloads","document","assets","functionality","identity management capabilities","infrastructure","leadership","search capability","portal","staff","site","AUI framework","theme","layouts","tablets","devices","filters","scroll","search results","software package uploads","cloud","extensibility","winner","award","vision","row","space","Marketing","partners","content management system","workflow","Schneider E-Business","search innovations","performance","search queries","basis","security","Gartner Magic Quadrant","world","platform","application development platform","team","platform","employees","look","reviews","Sales","manner","content management","management","Content Management System","Partner of the Year","users","assets","functionality improvements","projects","SolrCloud","conduit","advantages","team","user experience","search","marketing efforts","productivity","Evolve The Exchange","assets","project","site","value","applications","staff","organization","user interface","presentation","target audience","Exchange","assets","SSO","Single-Sign-On"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=grants-gov","text":"Grants.gov, an E-Government Initiative, was chartered in 2002 to deliver a single system that allows people to find and apply for federal funding opportunities online. Today, the Grants.gov system houses information on over 1,000 grant programs for federal grant-making agencies.   Grants.gov knew that its legacy platform required a new solution to bring it up to modern standards. Grants.gov serves 4 million page hits weekly with users from all over the globe. Its diverse and vast audience requires a solid platform that reliably meets user expectations, so users can focus on what they need to get done. Modernizing the site would be like fixing a bullet train while it was moving; there was no room for lengthy processes, backtracking or mistakes.   After extensive research, Grants.gov chose Liferay as its new platform solution, in part because its open source nature would reduce operating costs by allowing for more customized solutions than a proprietary vendor would. Grants.gov also liked that Liferay was secure, affordable and fit a modular architecture approach, which allowed the agency to build a hybrid platform with options of third-party plugins, custom coding and Liferay applications that integrated together.   Turning 17 Legacy Solutions Into a Single User Platform     The team at Grants.gov aimed to make Liferay the standard architecture for the site as they integrated 17 legacy solutions in a single user platform. Grants.gov took a templated approach to the information architecture. This allowed them to look holistically at Grants.gov and create a roadmap for bringing modules under the Liferay umbrella. They used Liferay templates to test new pages with global partners in order to ensure they were creating the most effective solution.     A key goal throughout the process was to enhance the user experience for everyone who interacted with Grants.gov. For business users, this meant using Liferay\u2019s out of the box content management system to maintain documents and web pages. Employees used to hire professional services whenever an update or change needed to be made. This new system gave them the flexibility to update content as they saw fit, as well as providing enormous cost savings in licensing fees and labor.     Grants.gov was able to use the new platform to create a custom interface for partners that apply for large numbers of grants, such as universities that have a large amount of government programs. These end users are now able to apply without ever going to the Grants.gov website. The team also created microsites and communities of interest in order to bring parties together and enable collaboration. Many funding opportunities require the collaboration of multiple agencies. The new platform made it easier to work within Grants.gov throughout the application process because of built-in capabilities for blogs, document management and discussion boards.     New Search Increased Usage by 98%     One of the largest challenges the team faced was redesigning the search experience. Search is the bread and butter of Grants.gov. They have to make it easy for people to find relevant funding opportunities from over 1,000 program options. The team at Grants.gov researched effective search experiences extensively while developing the plan, and the work paid off. The site went from a simple search method to a federated search with a Liferay and Solr implementation. People no longer have to know what they\u2019re applying for in order to find it; they can be directed to the right grant programs as they click through the filters, and results update in real time. After the new implementation with Liferay and Solr, Grants.gov saw search usage increase by 98%.     An Enhanced User Experience in Only Six Months     The new, modern website design has enhanced the user experience all around. As they updated the site, the team looked through every single web page and developed a roadmap that accounts for future enhancement plans. Once the requirements were determined, the development cycle of the entire site took six months from start to finish. The new site experience caused web traffic to jump, making Grants.gov the fourth most visited site in the government space.","keywords":["Grants.gov","system","users","Liferay","platform","legacy platform","funding opportunities","people","audience","grant programs","system","page","agencies","E-Government Initiative","team","People","information","standards","platform","globe","bullet train","solution","platform","everyone","Search","nature","user expectations","site","platform solution","solutions","part","grants","processes","business users","team","operating costs","room","site experience","User Platform","user platform","user experience","site","end users","solution","legacy solutions","mistakes","backtracking","vendor","research","site","partners","pages","content management system","web pages","system","partners","team","order","process","approach","architecture","information architecture","government programs","order","documents","applications","options","architecture approach","goal","roadmap","parties","search experiences","search","templates","content","interface","website","interest","agency","umbrella","box","Employees","change","services","update","flexibility","plugins","coding","grant programs","licensing fees","labor","numbers","universities","microsites","communities","roadmap","amount","collaboration","order","modules","Legacy Solutions Into a Single","team","plan","implementation","implementation","user experience","User Experience","site","site","site","funding opportunities","cost savings","search method","results","filters","search usage increase","web page","funding opportunities","enhancement plans","development cycle","Solr","work","website design","finish","requirements","web traffic","government space","search experience","agencies","application process","document management","Usage","program options","people","capabilities","blogs","discussion boards","challenges","butter","collaboration"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=advanced-energy","text":"As a global manufacturer of highly complex products that include thousands of components, Advanced Energy had no centralized system in place to collaborate with its suppliers.

A politically-led, cross-party organisation, the LGA works on behalf of councils to ensure local government has a strong, credible voice with national government. They aim to influence and set the political agenda on the issues that matter to councils so they are able to deliver local solutions to national problems.   In total, 421 authorities are members of the LGA. These include English Councils, the 22 Welsh councils via the Welsh LGA, fire authorities, passenger transport authorities, national parks via   corporate membership through the English National Park Authorities Association (ENPAA) and one town council.   Challenge     As a membership organisation the LGA works with a multi-faceted audience reflecting the diversity and complexity of local government in the UK. It covers a variety of political audiences of various persuasions alongside practitioners in a broad range of disciplines. The LGA therefore has a requirement to offer a wide range of different information sets to multiple audiences through its website. The organisation was also looking for a proven platform that was used by local authorities and other public bodies.     Given the website sits with the organisation's Marketing and Communication Department, a product that is technically easy to understand and use was vital to the success of the project     and key to the decision making process.     In line with UK government trends, the company also wanted to look at an Open Source, Open Standards solution. They needed the website (Content Management System) to integrate well with other online systems in order to leverage content across all their web platforms.     Finally, the LGA was seeking to minimise costs generated through over-reliance on a single provider of a customised proprietary solution, as had been the case previously.     The challenge was to deliver the following:           customised content based on personal profile and choices      integration with other enterprise systems      an Open Source and Open Standards solution      reduced costs      minimised reliance on a single provider          Resolution     When the LGA looked to consolidate its digital offering in 2011 it already had one development underway using Liferay. This experience showed that the portal platform could deliver the kind of user experience that the organisation and its members required. It also showed that Liferay could deliver a configurable system that would significantly reduce reliance on expensive custom coding.     The LGA was especially interested in the highly configurable user role and organisation functions of Liferay. This allowed the organisation to closely model the complexity of the audience and offer a more tailored, personal experience.     There were several platforms considered, but Liferay was chosen for its overall ability to deliver the access model required and integrate with other enterprise and web systems. The Open Source and Open Standards model offered by the software meant that the provider base was broad. This also made it very attractive for government use.     The main body of the initial work comprised of creating a comprehensive description covering all the required user types. The development team then worked to create a corresponding three dimensional security access matrix for all content and users. This was re-created in Liferay using a roles and access model onto which every one of the 121,000 registered users was mapped.     Core to the delivery of customised web content was the integration of the existing LDAP user database, which was a simple process using Liferay. All customer details were stored in LDAP and administered through Liferay.     In addition there were four political groups housed within the organisation, each requiring an extranet for its members. This entailed the production of four separate, locally administered sub-sites, created using a template with customisable look and feel. Each group received local admin access to their dedicated area of the main site.     Business Value Added     By allowing the integration of the existing customer contact base stored in the LDAP directory, Liferay gives the organisation the ability to leverage legacy business intelligence to personalise the user experience. Using customer tailored site delivery caters for a wide variety of needs across a heterogeneous audience. Liferay provides functionality and security features that allow the LGA to vary their offering to a wide variety of individual customers. This led to an increase of approximately 50,000 registrations over the 12 months from launch.     Councillors are a key audience for the LGA and it was able to offer dedicated web services to this audience segment for the first time. The ability to add sub-sites easily helped greatly in adding business value for the organisation by building support with this key demographic. There was a corresponding increase of about 5,000 new councillors following the addition of this service.     Internally streamlined workflows led to more efficient working, resulting in a 40% reduction in operating costs. Using workflow designs also allowed the organisation to implement a distributed web publishing model that gave key groups direct access to their own content, saving time and increasing efficiency.     Liferay integrated seamlessly with other back office and web systems. The organisation's social collaboration platform, Knowledge Hub, was also on Liferay. This allowed the LGA to leverage content from both systems, providing a joined-up digital offering and greater context for content.","keywords":["Liferay","councils","government","Local Government Association","authorities","government","voice","solution","issues","organisation","organisation","platform","government","councils","organisation","members","passenger transport authorities","fire authorities","solutions","product","voice","parks","agenda","problems","total","requirement","English Councils","membership organisation","organisation","organisation","platform","town council","user database","Welsh","audience","audiences","audiences","organisation","membership","authorities","complexity","website","website","content","content","Challenge","range","range","web publishing model","business value","UK","content","enterprise systems","system","audience","systems","Content Management System","diversity","disciplines","practitioners","persuasions","information sets","bodies","Marketing","ability","web systems","users","users","web platforms","user experience","audience","workflows","user experience","solution","solution","integration","experience","use","challenge","organisation","integration","kind","provider","offering","costs","complexity","organisation","company","costs","provider","model","work","model","provider base","support","ability","variety","reliance","development","one","reliance","functions","user role","decision making process","following","experience","Open Source","Open Standards","Councillors","audience","website","roles","model","enterprise","government use","Resolution","coding","National Park Authorities Association","English","project","success","government trends","line","order","over-reliance","choices","profile","customer","customers","group","workflow designs","legacy business intelligence","software","description","body","development team","security access matrix","ENPAA","organisation","Communication Department","variety","offering","variety","content","context","content","content","case","site delivery","functionality","increase","time","sub-sites","councillors","collaboration platform","web services","web systems","systems","needs","registrations","launch","audience segment","demographic","access","ability","working","increase","operating costs","groups","platforms","Business Value","user types","organisation","addition","service","security features","web content","reduction","efficiency","back office","admin access","offering","production","groups","integration","delivery","addition","sub-sites","site","customer contact base","template","customer details","look","feel","area","directory","Knowledge Hub","LDAP","extranet"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=schott","text":"A global innovator of specialty glass products, SCHOTT knows that getting products to the market quickly through effective communication is key to staying ahead of its competitors.

Since 1988, it provides its clients with counseling services relating to the design, development, implementation and operation of loyalty solutions, generating business results and high returns on investments (ROI). It has the mission of supporting its clients with the development of loyalty strategies based on the latest, most efficient methods and technology, resulting in more loyal and profitable consumers.   Challenge     Ampersand manages many loyalty programs for important clients, both in Mexico and South America. Its client list includes industries such as the Banking and Financial Industry, the Hospitality Industry, and the Consumer Goods and Services Industry - and each program requires its own business portal, in which registered clients may receive reward points for their purchases, and exchange these points for prizes stated in a catalog. The catalog presents the company's business rules, while explaining that points are won by performing purchases, payments and requesting delivery services.     At first, the systems were developed through a model that allowed no variation between its different programs' operational rules. It didn't allow the customization of the look and feel of each portal, nor the possibility to adapt itself to the model and services of each client. For these reasons, the company began a search for the best tools and techonlogy in the areas of Content Management (Content Management Services, and Enterprise Content Management), Business Rules Management Systems, and Enterprise Service Buses. The challenge was to integrate the business' core systems, while finding a way to present each client with a customized product, integrating them in a Service-Oriented Architecture.     Solution     Liferay was chosen from among many other products due to its flexibility to provide customized content, for its use of Java patterns, and for the large worldwide community of developers who share their positive experiences about the product, noting it's high cohesion and low coupling to integrate the market's leading technologies. For its ability to integrate with Siebel. It acquired a Gold subscription for Liferay support, being integrated to the RedHat Fuse Enterprise Service Bus, the RedHat JBoss BRMs, and the Apache Camel.     At the same time, many possible Mexican partners were evaluated, from which Global Quark - a Mexican Platinum Partner - was chosen to handle the implementation of the Liferay system, while crafting the integration strategy alongside RedHat, Siebel and Oracle - each on its own product segment, they managed to integrate a solution that would answer all the client's needs. Global Quark has the resources and qualifications from the Liferay Portal Training Program.     The Liferay system was customized through the use of Hooks, portlets capable of integrating RedHat Fuse's services were developed, and Siebel and Oracle were responsible for handling the business' core databases.     The Gold support was acquired as a way of dealing with all the difficulties that could surface during the implementation process, and through LESA, it was possible to receive direct support from Liferay.     Benefits     Many programs have been implemented to different clients from the drinks industry, achieving the goal of presenting a unique system - based on the customization of business rules and appearance - to each loyalty program and business portal. The largest program is currently accessed by 1 million users who regularly exchange points for products. From a technological point of view, it was possible to achieve independence for the maintenance and support of each individual loyalty program. New services were integrated, enhancing the previously existing ones. Programs were updated, including the implementation of multi-device access with crossbrowsing functionalities and responsive designs, allowing a single system to be customized and adapted to the rules of any given program. The process of creating and launching a loyalty program, which used to take a whole year, could now be completed in two months. Among the benefits brought by the Liferay platform, we can point out how our client portals began taking 30% less time to be executed; how 40% less time needed to be spent on maintenance and support; and how there was a 25% TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) reduction in our Loyalty platform.","keywords":["Ampersand","clients","Liferay","program","loyalty marketing services","Mexico","owner","vacation club","hotel brands","counseling services","Fiesta Americana","clients","model","Fiesta Americana Vacation Club","developers","implementation","development","loyalty solutions","Aqua","Grupo Posadas","Explorean Kohunlich In Mexico","Hoteles One","Fiesta Americana Grand","product","design","system","operation","business results","returns","investments","ROI","mission","business portal","solution","partners","loyalty programs","clients","variation","possibility","loyalty program","reward points","points","industries","development","technology","way","programs","services","Content Management Services","users","client","client list","client","loyalty strategies","consumers","catalog","purchases","business","Business Rules Management Systems","systems","systems","methods","portal","prizes","products","points","business rules","rules","Enterprise Content Management","Content Management","support","programs","challenge","Solution","company","Banking and Financial Industry","Hospitality Industry","Consumer Goods and Services Industry","techonlogy","company","loyalty program","program","loyalty program","services","Programs","South America","TCO","experiences","technologies","implementation","use","catalog","purchases","model","customization","subscription","market","integration strategy","business portal","content","Enterprise Service Buses","Service-Oriented Architecture","patterns","community","coupling","cohesion","flexibility","payments","feel","look","reasons","search","tools","areas","drinks industry","business rules","points","products","point of view","support","ability","product segment","delivery services","program","RedHat","system","customization","maintenance","designs","difficulties","client portals","goal","independence","ones","crossbrowsing functionalities","multi-device access","rules","support","Global Quark","Mexican Platinum Partner","implementation","platform","Loyalty platform","Java","process","benefits","maintenance","Oracle","JBoss BRMs","RedHat Fuse Enterprise Service Bus","Apache Camel","Mexican","services","client","clients","business","support","portlets","support","use","way","implementation process","Benefits","Liferay Portal Training Program","needs","qualifications","resources","Siebel","databases","RedHat Fuse","Gold","Hooks","LESA"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=csob","text":"\u010cSOB Group is a member of KBC Group, an integrated bank-assurance group, catering mainly for retail customers, small and medium-sized enterprises and private banking clientele.

Combining the power of its retail in banking (under \u010cSOB and Postal Savings Bank brands) and other areas (insurance, asset management, pension funds, leasing and factoring, the Mortgage Bank and the CMSS) \u2013 \u010cSOB Group holds strong market positions in all segments of Czech financial market.   Challenge     The \u010cSOB Group wants to fundamentally revise its direct channels approach based on a comprehensive view of its online landscape, as well as create a centralized, web-based platform that supports the following business transformation:           Transform into a customer-centric organization      Simplicity and convenience through multi-channel access and cross channel distribution      Extend its online service offering      Shorten time to market by introducing innovative approach to the new services implementation          Resolution     Within the group, it was decided that a portal would be the best functional and technological fit, and chose Liferay Portal. A range of portal options were evaluated to host the site and following a pre-study, Liferay emerged as the most suitable technology due to the following factors:           State-of-the-art in front-end layer and rich on features      Easy integration with J2EE, group development standard          Optimal fit into landscape and total cost of ownership As a proof of concept, \u010cSOB Group decided to execute a full 1-to-1 porting of its Postal Savings Bank brand into Liferay Portal. On the highest of levels, the project was divided into the following two parts:           Migration from the existing web Portal to Liferay      Implementation of bank requirements as new Enterprise Features for Liferay                 MIGRATION FROM PORTAL TO LIFERAY     The migration involved a porting of CMS (content) and webpart applications (functionality) from Microsoft SharePoint Server to Liferay Portal 6.0 EE.      Content Migration      A fully automated SharePoint-to-Liferay Content Migration application was implemented in order to allow content migrations to be repeatable across all environment pillars and re-useable for future utilization in other SharePoint-driven portals. The approach of the site-wide migration employed a 2-pass mechanism; automated inspection via SharePoint APIs and export of the SharePoint CMS content into an export package, followed by a Java-based import of all content using the Liferay API.      Functional Migration      The functional migration scope involved porting over roughly 50 web-part applications implemented in .NET (with highly customized behavior that had been integrated to bank backends and 3rd-party services) into JSR-286 compliant portlet applications deployed into Liferay. This was accomplished through agile development iterations over the course of 3 months.            IMPLEMENTATION OF BANK REQUIREMENTS AS NEW ENTERPRISE FEATURES FOR LIFERAY     The project was presented with an exhaustive list of business requirements to be delivered throughout the course of the implementation. Many requirements were satisfied through Liferay's comprehensive suite of out-of-the-box tools. Additional features were also implemented and seamlessly integrated into the portal, including:           Legacy Links Management      Reference Management      Link Integrity Management      Google Analytics Framework          Business Value Added     Following the successful deployment of the \u010cSOB proof of concept, \u010cSOB has continued to work with Liferay and their implementation partner, the Emeldi Group, on new development and enhancements on their portal framework.

It has 200,000 employees across 64 countries and working in four main fields: innovative materials, construction products, building distribution and packaging. They are all focused on the same strategy: the habitat of the future. Its industrial expertise and unique form of distribution proven over 350 years means that Saint-Gobain has huge innovation potential in terms of finding solutions to challenges in the areas of growth, energy sector, and environmental protection. The organization is divided along three lines: sectors, functions (Finance, R&D, HR, Marketing\/Communication, Legal\/Fiscal and IT, which come under the holding company \"La Compagnie Saint-Gobain\"), and countries (13 general delegations). They coordinate around 50 activities carried out by 1,000 different companies\/brands, including Lapeyre, Point.P, Isover, La Plateforme du B\u00e2timent and KparK in France.   Challenge     A quarter of Saint-Gobain's products did not exist five years ago. In fact, the Group's capacity for innovation saw it file close to 400 patents in 2013. To sustain this innovation \u2013 a key source of growth and competitiveness \u2013 the group had to have a quality Information System, including a group intranet. This information portal, which is accessed daily by more than 12,000 users, is becoming outdated and lacks flexibility. Users log on either anonymously or using their login details, but response times are slow, especially in Asia. Their solution maintenance expired in 2013, which made the Digital Solutions team consider different tools. \"We wanted users to be able to manage content and create web pages themselves\", explained Sarah Mocchi, Communication Tools Project Manager. Saint-Gobain also had specific deadlines and cost constraints to meet, as well as wanting to reduce the number of its servers.     Resolution     After considering the different options, Saint-Gobain chose Liferay because it was the only solution that fulfilled all of the group's criteria. There were several reasons behind their choice to migrate the existing portal to Liferay.     The first was user acceptance. They found the portal to be more open and user-friendly. In addition to technological considerations, the solution worked for the businesses. \"Liferay reflected the mindset of our users\", stated Edouard Jopp\u00e9, Portal & Collaboration Services Manager. \"They instantly became aware of the solution's many benefits, and they quickly picked it up\". The solution was also thought to be more robust and scalable, and its ability to integrate with third-party applications was another draw. Many users accessed documents (with the internal document management tool), collaborative platform communities, stock prices, etc. through applications (portlets).     Furthermore, other solutions were thought to be too \"French\". Half of the technical team working on the portal solution is based in India, so online resources and user forums contribute to increasing the expertise of the team in India. The flexibility and readiness of Open Source and Java technologies were also key factors in the decision-making process. Finally, the cost of the solution and implementation deadlines were also considered. Liferay definitely responded to all of Saint-Gobain's needs.     Business Value Added     The main added value for Saint-Gobain was the fact that users could contribute autonomously and that management of the different sites could be delegated to the different businesses. In less than an hour, the Digital Solutions team had created a website with the \"Saint-Gobain\" theme and had trained users. The team doesn't insist on one particular model but does ensure consistency in the navigation. Users can then manage their websites in the way they see fit. They can create and manage their own pages and content, and instantly see their members using the \"staging or remote staging\" function. This function, which is active on all sites, is particularly useful to business users. \"It means we don't have to stick to one model; we can be more flexible\", said Edouard Jopp\u00e9. \"The group's intranet portal has become a website factory\", he continued. Today, we have 255 websites, which are either public or restricted by access. Information governance is significant and the team will soon be able to more accurately calculate access statistics for the different pages.     The financial ROI is also impressive. Even taking into consideration the fact that the two portals existed in parallel for a while, maintenance costs were significantly reduced and the number of servers was cut in half. \"The cost of migrating the existing solution to Liferay was offset in one year by the savings we made through subscriptions and reducing the number of servers\", Edouard Jopp\u00e9 pointed out. \"And we haven't encountered any technical or business headaches during migration. Users have all been very enthusiastic because Liferay is so much simpler and more flexible than our previous solution, so user acceptance has been straightforward. In the beginning, our partner SQLI helped us with the project's framework and architecture, and implemented some specific developments. Now everything is handled by our teams in France and India. Nevertheless, the team is smaller than before because Liferay natively integrates several functions, such as the multilingual element, which for us is crucial\".     Liferay has fully met all of the expectations of the Saint-Gobain Digital Solutions team. Portal traffic has doubled. 24,000 people now use it daily without any deterioration in service, and with faster response times in Asia for user logins. \"Liferay has completely transformed the way we work. Decentralized terminal management has meant that the support team is free to concentrate on other value added tasks\", concluded Mr Jopp\u00e9.     In the future, Saint-Gobain plans to continue consolidating its different business intranet portals. Furthermore, the IT team is now looking into mobility and making the portal more easily internally accessible to mobile users on tablets and smartphones.","keywords":["Saint-Gobain","Edouard Jopp\u00e9","Liferay","Users","team","one","Finance","groups","solutions","employees","world","revenue","number","information portal","users","holding company","functions","Users","expertise","Communication","solution","value","building distribution","construction products","countries","energy sector","growth","challenges","terms","distribution","sectors","IT","ability","user acceptance","materials","fields","packaging","strategy","habitat","form","protection","areas","innovation potential","Marketing","R&D","lines","organization","delegations","capacity","servers","activities","SQLI","users","solution maintenance","management","Digital Solutions","users","France","patents","group","HR","Users","fact","solution","companies","users","competitiveness","users","solution","solution","solutions","solution","innovation","innovation","users","team","India","solution","Portal","portlets","portal","portal","countries","products","Challenge","cost","growth","source","flexibility","Sarah Mocchi","resources","times","team","La Compagnie Saint-Gobain","businesses","login details","function","brands","group","all","Business Value","Information System","team","user acceptance","servers","cost constraints","considerations","all","businesses","Group","solution","solution","factors","consistency","Resolution","platform communities","document management tool","expertise","tools","web pages","group intranet","website","websites","teams","team","applications","applications","documents","Half","content","deadlines","reasons","Asia","deadlines","sites","model","way","business","support team","mindset","benefits","stock prices","user forums","websites","options","criteria","choice","addition","users","maintenance costs","cost","decision-making process","technologies","readiness","implementation","needs","theme","navigation","Point.P","KparK","La Plateforme du B\u00e2timent","Isover","IT team","business intranet portals","portal","half","project","Portal traffic","all","parallel","subscriptions","savings","migration","framework","architecture","developments","beginning","everything","service","team","functions","Open Source","expectations","business users","value","French","Lapeyre","terminal management","user logins","times","way","Java","intranet portal","portals","headaches","fact","element","deterioration","tasks","smartphones","tablets","mobility","flexibility","website factory","group","consideration","function","access","pages","pages","Information governance","ROI","people","staging","content","sites","model","members","access statistics"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=societe-generale","text":"Societe Generale is one of the largest European financial services groups.

Camden's services needed a complete overhaul to create a user-friendly online offering that would be highly efficient and provide much better value. The online service experience needed to be personalised for citizens and local businesses, as well as simplified with a single sign-on for a streamlined services experience. The Council's business objective was to move 85% of their transactions online by 2015, helping to drive down costs, increase their business agility and improve customer services.     Resolution     The Council prioritised service delivery and end user experience, and local residents and businesses expected a range of features: a single point of contact, viewable status and history of transactions, customised content and automated messaging and transaction confirmation. The Council quickly realised that the best way to meet every requirement and ensure the necessary flexibility for future innovation was to build an open source solution from the \u2018bottom up', built around user needs. Initial in-house testing demonstrated Liferay Portal's ability to execute. The Council commissioned a formal evaluation with Gartner, who recognise Liferay as a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals. Their expert analysis proved to be a deciding factor into executive buy-in.     Liferay now powers the user interaction end of Camden's solutions: a business portal and a citizen-facing portal. These portals offer single points of contact where businesses and citizens can access information and transact securely and simply with the council. Businesses and citizens have unique needs and frequencies of interaction with the Council. However, Liferay's flexibility meant the majority of development work for one portal could be integrated into the other. Other key components included:           High level of configurability      A wealth of out-of-the-box features      Standards compliance      Enterprise grade support and UK-based account management      Interoperability and integration capabilities(including Facebook, Google and Open ID login; legacy line of business application using Camden's integrated business services (SOA) and GIS addressing service; and financial information systems)          Liferay's agility allows for extensions of the portals to be taken in stages, significantly cutting time to market. From the first installation of Liferay, a citizen-facing portal was live in just twelve weeks. Within the following 15 months, Camden had achieved two further releases on the citizen-facing portal, and two on the business portal.     Business Value Added     Local and central government face an ongoing challenge: to revolutionise service delivery and drive out waste and inefficiency. By leveraging Liferay, Camden now offer a simple and personal online experience in place of costly, traditional channels of service delivery. Camden have saved \"well over \u00a31 million already by adopting a sensible, efficient online offer with Liferay,\" said John Jackson, Assistant Director of ICT. \"In the next phase of development we're looking at a multimillion pound number in savings by fundamentally re-engineering the services that we provide. That re-engineering is not just about automation \u2013 it's about re-thinking the way those processes are delivered.\"     In addition to cost saving, Camden's commitment to open systems and open standards creates exciting opportunities for innovation and collaboration with other organisations. Future planned releases for Camden's portals include higher-level services for more sensitive layers of data, as well as use of Liferay's standard auditing portlet in conjunction with the Council's auditing and error-handling processes.     As government evolves to the next phase of web development, moving from delivering simple transactions to a unified online customer experience, there will be significant opportunity for innovation and savings offered by Open Standards-based software. Liferay and Camden are committed to continue working together to offer a local government solution on Liferay Marketplace, a one-stop site for sharing and downloading Liferay-compatible applications. Organisations interested in such a solution are welcome to contact Liferay.","keywords":["Council","flow","Liferay Portal","areas","one","capital","Camden Council","spaces","Council","portal","services","services","businesses","London","area","offering","building control","council","borough","home","areas","commuters","Hampstead Heath","King's Cross","processes","capital","residents","housing","London Borough of Camden","jurisdiction","population","visitors","children","care","Parts","contact","Council","portals","services","services","service","Scrutiny committees","services","Holborn","Covent Garden","end users","open source solution","experience","transaction","government","standards","customer services","ICT systems","service offerings","business portal","businesses","businesses","businesses","business services","service","Challenge","portal","Businesses","processes","citizens","performance","services experience","citizens","end user experience","cases","usability","cohesion","lack","set","situation","John Jackson","transactions","contact","transactions","content","transaction","citizens","solutions","services","flexibility","number","value","overhaul","innovation","portals","user interaction end","service delivery","factor","interaction","Liferay Marketplace","integration","account management Interoperability","components","other","information systems","user needs","information","costs","business agility","features","point","confirmation","way","business objective","points","range","level","features","business application","contacts","needs","testing","ability","evaluation","leader","expert analysis","executive","sign-on","history","status","Resolution","messaging","requirement","standards","frequencies","majority","development work","SOA","GIS","legacy line","login","Standards compliance Enterprise grade support","capabilities","wealth","releases","flexibility","auditing portlet","offer","development","savings","systems","commitment","cost saving","innovation","residents","re-engineering","ICT","phase","number","way","opportunities","organisations","customer experience","government","automation","collaboration","addition","transactions","agility","opportunity","solution","solution","portal","processes","web development","innovation","savings","Gartner","Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals","portals","business portal","auditing","phase","UK","Google","Open ID","Organisations","layers","data","use","conjunction","error","software","experience","Open Standards","service delivery","service delivery","Facebook","applications","market","releases","challenge","Business Value","stages","extensions","installation","inefficiency","waste","channels","place"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=statistic-lithuania","text":"The Lithuanian Department of Statistics (Statistics Lithuania) is the public authority that coordinates official statistics for the country. Employing statistical methodological principles, the department compiles, processes, analyses and publishes official statistics on economic, social, demographic and environmental changes in the country. They are responsible for preparing and disseminating the statistics necessary for decision-making and stimulating public discussions on issues relevant to the country, and to actively participate in the development of international statistics.   Statistics Lithuania's strategic objective is to improve the quality and accessibility of statistical services and products by using resources responsibly and without increasing the statistical reporting burden for respondents. Statistical information is accessible to all users interested in the socioeconomic development of Lithuania and is available free of charge on the website of Statistics Lithuania.   Challenge     Statistics Lithuania coordinates the activities of a number of different ministries and institutions in the field of official statistics. Together they produce regional and administrative-territorial statistical indicators throughout the country. However, because statistical information is collected from different sources and published in different ways, it has historically been difficult to collate the data and make it accessible and user-friendly for the public. They needed a one-stop gateway for users to access data in a clear, user-friendly format.     Solution     Liferay Portal was chosen as the platform for two new portals: a new customer portal for affiliated organizations and the new Official Statistics Portal. The portal delivers information in a clear and consistent format regardless of which institution prepared the data. Users now have a customized experience that is easy to navigate, with tabular views, interactive graphs, and maps. In addition, users can create their own data sets, add new statistical indicators, and create derivate and summary reports. They can customize reports according to their preferences and share results through social media portlets. If there is any data that is not available through the portal, users can now request additional services and access the results online.     Decisive factors in selecting Liferay Portal included a low total cost of ownership and the availability of enterprise-level support. On a technical level, Liferay Portal's content management capabilities met the requirements of the portal. The open source model also allowed for standard features to be customized and for custom development to be integrated into the platform.     The project was implemented by Affecto Lietuva, an official Liferay Partner.     Business Value Added     The public now benefits from an Official Statistics Portal that is both intuitive and attractive. Currently the portal is accessed by up to 1,000 concurrent users, and Statistics Lithuania expect the number of users and their satisfaction with the user experience to continue increasing. In the future, more institutions are expected to join the customer portal for organizations, thereby increasing the data and knowledge base found on the Official Statistics Portal. The growth in public interest is also expected to continue climbing as the portal evolves into the primary gateway to statistical information for Lithuania.     Additional benefits include a decrease in expenditure for on-site support for customer organizations. The flexibility and tools that come out-of-the-box with the Liferay platform empower the users themselves to create content and contribute to the portal without drawing on technical resources. As the data and user needs grow, the platform's agility will allow the portal to grow and adapt to future developments.     In the future, all statistical indicators produced under the Official Statistics Work Programme are planned to be integrated into the Portal, which will substantially improve their comparability and analysis possibilities.","keywords":["Lithuanian Department of Statistics","statistics","Official Statistics Portal","Statistics Lithuania","information","country","Challenge Statistics Lithuania","users","statistics","statistics","country","development","country","data","department","reports","principles","changes","issues","decision-making","discussions","analyses","experience","Lithuania","portal","processes","users","activities","statistics","statistics","users","Portal","flexibility","users","customer portal","portals","development","social media portlets","portal","portal","reporting","institutions","indicators","users","objective","Users","resources","services","number","data","data","indicators","accessibility","respondents","burden","products","quality","website","charge","Liferay Portal","field","ministries","portal","information","country","platform","data","organizations","institution","indicators","customer portal","format","institutions","sources","public","format","data","factors","results","results","support","level","maps","graphs","views","summary","addition","data sets","derivate","ways","Solution","portal","gateway","agility","portal","information","preferences","share","availability","cost","ownership","content management capabilities","requirements","growth","organizations","customer organizations","expenditure","benefits","gateway","support","data","project","knowledge base","interest","decrease","tools","Affecto Lietuva","platform","platform","developments","portal","users","users","content","resources","analysis","services","comparability","possibilities","user needs","development","platform","Business Value","user experience","number","public","features","open source model","satisfaction","Official Statistics Work Programme"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=south-worcestershire-district-councils","text":"SW2 is the ICT Shared Service for the three south Worcestershire councils: Malvern Hills District Council, Worcester City Council and Wychavon District Council. They support approximately 1000 users through their Customer Self Service Portal, and about 120 traditional client server business applications. SW2 has adopted a self-service view of business, putting the customer first and making end-to-end interactions fully available online as much as possible. Their strategy is to consolidate on and migrate to a web-based infrastructure, basing as many applications in the browser as possible. This has led to the implementation of more open source software applications and tools.   Challenge     SW2 has limited resources and a small development team who decided it was worthwhile creating their own middleware systems to link web applications to back office systems. Internally, they had three different intranet solutions (SharePoint Server 2007, SharePoint and traditional CMS), and different methods of application development. They required an intranet solution that offered a portal as well as a development environment on top of a CMS. Externally, they sought a solution which would help them achieve their self service goals and also offer the development base they needed.     Resolution     The SW2 team evaluated SharePoint, Alfresco and MindTouch, but none offered everything required in a single offering, or fit the ICT Strategy to move to open source solutions and to provide self service to users. Liferay met these requirements and was chosen to replace SharePoint. With Liferay Portal EE, SW2 appreciated the availability of support and training as well as the large user base.     Setting up Liferay Portal was very easy, and it allowed SW2 to quickly replicate the sites and features they had in SharePoint. The built-in applications enabled them to quickly set up sites for teams, and sped up the migration to Liferay. Using Linux running on VMware servers and a MySQL database made it easy to take snapshots before upgrades or deploying solutions. The service areas using Liferay picked it up right away, and the standard look and feel was much preferred to that of SharePoint. Liferay offered the CMS, development environment and portal server needed to run the Customer Self Service Portal while providing a consistent interface for the public.     Business Value Added     The applications developed in Liferay are helping the councils to accelerate the channel shift to online applications and speed up interactions for both customers and back office staff. This is now reducing the need for costly face-to-face, telephone or written interactions.     Internally, the ROI has been much greater than using SharePoint and, after moving to Liferay Portal, SW2 now has a single system and a central place for employees at the councils to find information and work collaboratively. Much of the data the councils hold, as well as some of the legacy applications that staff use, have their own expensive web front end, and the consolidation removes this cost.","keywords":["Liferay","SW2","Challenge SW2","SW2","councils","solution","users","ICT Shared Service","Malvern Hills District Council","Worcester City Council","Wychavon District Council","client server business applications","SharePoint","Customer Self Service Portal","Worcestershire","councils","customer","business","development team","resources","self-service view","intranet solution","solutions","applications","applications","applications","legacy applications","strategy","interactions","applications","none","web applications","infrastructure","browser","implementation","open source software","tools","portal","application development","intranet solutions","self service","team","users","middleware systems","back office systems","CMS","applications","teams","Resolution","Strategy","development environment","development base","ROI","user base","sites","sites","SharePoint Server 2007","self service goals","offering","requirements","methods","top","everything","availability","interactions","customers","interactions","support","training","migration","Business Value","CMS","back office staff","information","interface","public","channel shift","telephone","need","ICT","system","end","MindTouch","Alfresco","data","consolidation","Liferay Portal EE","servers","server","employees","place","some","staff use","cost","Much","solutions","snapshots","database","development environment","look","upgrades","service areas","feel","Customer Self Service Portal","Linux","VMware","MySQL"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=apicil","text":"Apicil is a social protection group based in Lyon, France, which was formed by employees and companies in 1938.

The company's big data, integration and business process technologies enable customers to drive operational efficiency, modernize their systems and optimize processes for smarter decisions and better service. Building on over 40 years of customer-centric innovation, the company is ranked as a leader in 15 market categories, fueled by core product families Adabas and Natural, ARIS, Terracotta and webMethods. Software AG has ca. 5,300 employees in 70 countries and had revenues of \u20ac1.05 billion in 2012.   TECHcommunity is Software AG's new, dynamic one-stop portal that connects the user community with the company's developer assets and channels related to its leading products: Adabas-Natural, ARIS, Terracotta and webMethods. Customers depend heavily on TECHcommunity for the latest product updates, demos and trial downloads, collaborative tools and an ever-growing knowledge base.   Challenge     In recent years beginning in 2005, Software AG has reported record results and made substantial acquisitions. These developments resulted in enormous growth in all areas of the enterprise. Moreover, the correlating expansion of the company's portfolio and its customer base greatly impacted the needs of Software AG's developer community. The fast-growing employee and TECHcommunity grew a member base of 3.000 in 2005 to currently over 35.000 members. In addition, it was particularly influenced by a younger generation joining the workforce. This generation, which grew up with the Internet and fast-paced technology growth, expected familiar features within the workplace such as personalized content, individual profiles, and social media integration.     With a lean team and equally lean budget, the company had to find a solution to cope with this explosive growth. In 2011, Software AG began searching for a low-cost, high-value solution to improve user experience, provide better social collaboration capabilities amongst community users, and improve personalization. As the community grew over time, new functionalities had been introduced on an isolated, component-by-component level. The situation called for a long-term solution that would integrate disparate information sources and, at the same time, provide a modern look and feel. Additional requirements included customization and networking functionalities.     Resolution     Software AG has standardized on open source as part of their technology strategy since 2007, benefiting from the resulting low cost and high flexibility. The team researched several open source technologies and in a side-by-side comparison, Liferay met best the 50 core requirements compared to the alternatives. The final deciding factors in favor of Liferay Portal included:           A strong user community, reflecting the product's maturity and the longevity of the technology.      A flexible solution with excellent integration capabilities.      A technology based on open standards.          In 2012 Software AG re-launched the developer community as the brand new \u2018TECHcommunity', with Liferay at the front end. It offers a new look and feel, and new functionalities that meet the needs of the next generation of developers. With Liferay, the community portal now offers user registration and profile updates, collaboration tools such as wikis and blogs, social networking capabilities between community members, and a customizable interface that allows Software AG to quickly personalize its campaigns and key assets.     Rather than replacing the existing system entirely, Liferay seamlessly integrated the new functionalities into all major components of the solution. This saved time on development and was also less intrusive than overwriting pre-existing functionalities\u2014an important reassurance for existing community members who were fluent with the previous system. A large set of out-of-the-box tools allowed for the quick development of custom portlets. TECHcommunity was built using a single technical resource in less than six months.     Business Value Added     TECHcommunity began reaping the benefits of the redesign immediately. In its first year of implementation the number of users saw a record 25% growth. The community has greatly benefitted from improved collaboration and problem-solving capabilities and the site now supports over 35,000 registered members.     Software AG has also seen an increase in views and contribution to its TECHniques Magazine. Previously only in print, the magazine content is now available on the TECHcommunity blog and has up to 10,000 readers, providing a measurable communication channel for Software AG. Customer satisfaction and loyalty have gone up, and Liferay has greatly improved the community's usability for both old and new community members. There is an improved perception and interest in TECHcommunity as it has seen a measurable increase in member contribution and engagement.     \"Community managers are empowered by Liferay's usability and rich feature set. Small projects at Software AG no longer need to spend rare technical resources,\" said Gerd Schneider, Vice President, Global Communities at Software AG. \"A social media portlet, for example, does not have to be developed from scratch, but can simply be integrated out-of-the-box into the community site.

With their LGT SmartBanking initiative, they are creating a service that prioritizes their customers\u2019 changing digital needs above all else. LGT\u2019s goal was to make all current and future banking services available on mobile devices anywhere, anytime. In addition to customer services, LGT also wanted to create an employee portal that gave access to customized information and company services.   Based on a preliminary project study and a detailed implementation program, LGT SmartBanking was carefully designed to replace the current eBanking solution. LGT thus reinvented its international digital service offering to provide quicker, better and more personal customer experience.     LGT SmartBanking was an important component of LGT\u2019s digital strategy, so special attention was paid to researching customer needs during the planning phase. Flexibility was especially important, since the initiative was part of a long-term eBanking strategy that will require future development. The new portal software needed to integrate with legacy systems and third-party systems, while keeping to the scheduled timeline. Another important factor was the ability to integrate the system with the existing IT landscape as well as with third-party systems. To evaluate the requirements and make the final decision, stakeholders from asset management, consulting and sales were involved throughout the process. The team selected the Avaloq Front Platform (AFP), which includes Liferay as the central portal, for the LGT SmartBanking solution.     Following the successful completion of the pilot phase, the international rollout began in autumn 2015 and will be implemented in stages through 2017. A team of stakeholders will gather feedback as they interact with customers. This feedback from customers and other users will be applied in each stage of the project roll out, ensuring constant improvement and agile development. LGT SmartBanking will eventually be used by LGT banks in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong.   LGT SmartBanking provides a consistent and fully-integrated platform for a variety of current and future individual applications. All users, including customers, relationship managers, prospects and intermediaries, will be able to access this platform from both desktop and mobile devices.

Their area of expertise is one of the most important sectors of strategic importance to the national economy and the domestic electricity industry. Mavir ZRt's main duties are to provide reliable, efficient and secure operation of the Hungarian Power System including the required reserve capacities of generation and transmission. It ensures the undisturbed operation and further extension of the electricity market and access on equal terms for system users.   Challenge     Mavir looked to renew their existing corporate web page. They wanted a modern, flexible, and customizable portal solution that could also be applicable for future developments and a potential future intranet. Mavir's previous portal could not fulfill these needs.     The primary goal was to create an easy-to-use portal that features separate roles for content editors and reviewers by pages, and provides the ability to work with existing systems in their infrastructure. Since the most important functions of the extranet are communication and sharing of valuable and relevant information to visitors, it was imperative that portal operation was fast and effective.     Resolution     In order to find the best suitable solution, Mavir invited several reputable companies to its closed-door tendering process. Webtown, Liferay Hungary Ltd's first service partner, eventually won the tender. The company proved to be trustworthy as it was solely responsible for managing the development and installation process.     During the pilot project, Webtown demonstrated opportunities in Liferay that eventually convinced Mavir to make the switch. These benefits included standards compliance, easy integration with other systems, broad functionality, and easy-to-use user interfaces. In addition, Mavir was impressed with the diversity of Liferay's standard box tools as demonstrated by collaboration features, calendar, and webform.     As the liberalization of the Hungarian electric market generated a need for information from the vendor's side, Webtown developed Liferay portlets that visualized huge amounts of real-time and static data needed for daily trading operations. These graphs displayed the current accurate system load, statistic-based predictions, and import-export data all based on xml responses from the \"Spectrum\" system.     However, the main features that were used during the project were CMS and staging. The staging system had to be rewritten at the core level to handle editors and reviewers who only had access to some of the pages, according to LDAP user groups. The editing rights are now limited according to user levels and groups upon signing in. Webtown had implemented the page level and menu level entitlement for the process of editing and approving links with SSO from Novell eDirectory. Webtown has also developed a CMS hook that implements extend-collapse functionality to fulfill the special needs of Mavir.     Liferay Portal satisfied all of Mavir's expectations as the system is performing well, and Mavir wishes to continue the project long-term with the help of Webtown.","keywords":["Mavir ZRt","Mavir","Webtown","organization","group","experience","portal","part","traditions","MAVIR Hungarian Transmission System Operator Company Ltd.","Liferay Hungary Ltd","Z\u00e1rtk\u00f6r\u0171en M\u0171k\u00f6d\u0151 R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g","solution","one","expertise","\u00c1tviteli Rendszerir\u00e1ny\u00edt\u00f3","MVM","MAVIR Magyar Villamosenergia","area","importance","systems","economy","electricity industry","sectors","company","duties","editors","opportunities","operation","system users","web page","solution","transmission","terms","access","electricity market","operation","operation","Mavir","systems","generation","extension","Challenge","Hungarian Power System","Webtown","companies","portal","pages","content editors","Mavir","staging system","communication","tendering process","needs","standards compliance","functions","features","installation process","pilot project","functionality","information","service partner","tender","development","developments","reviewers","goal","benefits","user interfaces","integration","collaboration features","visitors","Resolution","order","intranet","infrastructure","reserve capacities","extranet","sharing","roles","level","pages","user levels","page level","webform","addition","diversity","box tools","calendar","project","user groups","groups","staging","access","reviewers","ability","switch","some","editing rights","system","level","editing","process","functionality","special needs","expectations","project","all","system","links","menu","entitlement","CMS hook","help","CMS","trading operations","LDAP","portlets","need","data","information","market","import-export data","amounts","vendor","side","liberalization","predictions","xml responses","system load","Novell eDirectory","SSO","graphs","Hungarian","Spectrum"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=thales-global-services","text":"Thales is a global technology leader for the Aerospace, Space, Transport, Defense and Security markets.

In the heart of London, the hotel boasts over 400 luxury bedrooms, a health spa, a private cinema and exceptional fine dining. The May Fair has a prestigious history and was first opened by King George V in 1927. Today it combines boutique attention to detail with grand hotel service, and enjoys partnerships with important cultural events such as London Fashion Week and the BFI London Film Festival.   Challenge     As the group\u2019s flagship property, The May Fair is unique in its exclusivity and standard of luxury. Following a recent \u00a3100 million renovation, the hotel needed to reestablish its brand both physically and virtually. The hotel required a fresh new website with a sophisticated look and feel which set it apart from other hotels and created an inviting overall online experience for the guest.     The hotel\u2019s original website was unimaginative and lacked key functionalities. The May Fair needed a solution that integrated essential e-commerce functions for accommodation and restaurant bookings, microsites for the spa and conference facilities and more. In addition, the previous website was operated remotely by an overseas team. Modifying the site or implementing new features were long and drawn out processes that hindered the hotel\u2019s business agility \u2013 one change to the website could take several months to implement. A complete overhaul of the website, its functionalities and look and feel was required.     Solution     Liferay was chosen because it could deliver an exceptional look and feel, as well as all the essential functionalities. Room bookings were integrated with the central reservations system, private pages could be created for exclusive guests or special events, and an analytics system was introduced. Further integrations with Apache, SSL for bookings and transactions, single sign-on and multivariate testing features were also implemented to create a high-value business solution. Together, all these capabilities created a seamless, personalised experience that made guests feel welcome and want to return to the website and to the hotel itself. The May Fair in turn was able to cultivate valuable relationships with its guests, analyse return visits and user behaviour, and deliver a highly customised experience.     As an open source technology, Liferay offered the freedom to build a solution around the guests\u2019 needs \u2013 the central tenet to the hospitality industry. Having previously been locked into a high-cost proprietary solution, the team building The May Fair site welcomed Liferay\u2019s lightweight platform and used it to create an agile solution that could be customised further as needed. The result is a unique online experience that reflects the ethos and character of The May Fair, with an agility that means changes to content, layout and integration now happen within days rather than months. Liferay\u2019s product maturity, its wealth of out-of-the-box features, and the health of its open source community assured Radisson that it was the right choice.     Business Value Added     The new website now gives The May Fair the dynamic web presence such a unique hotel requires. Messaging can be tailored for the visitor, particularly for returning guests, and the content is kept fresh so that visitors return to the website again and again. Since implementing Liferay, the number of new and returning online visitors has grown, as has revenue through online reservations. The May Fair site is now an attractive and enjoyable journey for the visitor, and the ability to deliver a great web experience increases loyalty to the brand and, ultimately, drives business revenue.     Liferay's usability has also benefitted the hotels group by increasing employee productivity and collaboration. Every Radisson Blu Edwardian employee logs in each day through the Liferay platform to get information and to collaborate with their fellow employees. Business units also use Liferay to communicate externally. The platform's usability and its use of permissioning and roles empower the ordinary business user with the ability to manage the site without depending heavily on the e-commerce team.     There are now seven different sites in the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotels group built on Liferay, including a mobile site for The May Fair. The potential for further innovation is vast, and the group anticipates major developments in the near future \u2013 including a new property development in Leicester Square. Like the May Fair, this is likely to require its own branding exercise, and creative new concepts are also being explored for the hotels' food and beverage segments. Liferay's agility and scalability are making these developments possible, and the knowledge accumulated will continue to be embedded throughout all aspects of the business and exploited as much as possible, multiplying the value of their investment in Liferay.","keywords":["Liferay","hotels group","experience","flagship property","May Fair Hotel","developments","George V","hotel","hotel","Radisson Blu Edwardian","group","hotel","flagship property","Challenge","health spa","events","look","bedrooms","dining","heart","cinema","history","detail","grand hotel service","partnerships","solution","experience","overhaul","London","hotels","hotel","integrations","website","employee logs","solution","agility","website","processes","journey","BFI London Film Festival","London Fashion Week","guest","experience","changes","usability","functionalities","e-commerce functions","boutique attention","hotel","hotel","solution","brand","restaurant bookings","luxury","feel","spa","change","website","website","website","business solution","guests","guests","guests","standard","exclusivity","renovation","site","Solution","guests","more","microsites","accommodation","conference","facilities","addition","experience","return visits","site","solution","functionalities","functionalities","bookings","multivariate testing features","team","features","business agility","Room bookings","website","platform","features","feel","look","feel","events","system","reservations","analytics system","hotel","integration","content","health","site","transactions","sign-on","capabilities","sites","relationships","turn","user behaviour","open source technology","needs","tenet","hotels group","freedom","hospitality industry","team building","ethos","character","layout","product maturity","wealth","open source community","hotels","pages","information","employees","platform","e-commerce team","platform","business revenue","usability","employee productivity","ability","business user","business","Radisson","knowledge","collaboration","roles","use","group","visitors","value","agility","SSL","Apache","potential","Business units","Radisson Blu Edwardian","website","website","Business Value","innovation","beverage","food","segments","investment","aspects","scalability","site","visitor","visitors","web experience","visitor","property development","brand","content","revenue","reservations","ability","choice","Messaging","loyalty","concepts","guests","Leicester Square","number","branding exercise","web presence"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=medimpact","text":"MedImpact HealthCare Systems, Inc., is the nation's largest full-service Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) deriving revenue through independent drug benefit management rather than benefit management with conflicting interests due to drug fulfillment. MedImpact uses information technology and human capital to improve the practice of managed care pharmacy. MedImpact partners with the nation's finest health plans, hospitals and employers to provide pharmacy benefit management services to more than 35 million members. Clients include corporations and employers, unions, managed care organizations, health plans, insurance carriers, and third-party administrators, as well as local, state and federal employee programs. Founded in 1989, MedImpact is a private company with offices in San Diego, Calif. and a state-of-the-art call and operations center in Tempe, Ariz.   Challenge     MedImpact works with hundreds of organizations to provide pharmacy benefits. While benefit programs have many features in common, each program has a unique combination of offerings for its members. For example, programs may optionally include consumer-directed tools such as spending accounts, cash discount cards, member websites, or a health management system. Delivering a custom website for each organization's operations staff and their members is nontrivial.     In addition to the variability of individual benefit programs, MedImpact must comply with a wide spectrum of federal, state, and local regulations. For instance, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide guidelines for eligibility, enrollment and disenrollment in Prescription Drug Benefit Plans, and websites must follow standards in terms of prescriptive language as well as for people with disabilities as specified by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act And the rapidly changing face of healthcare regulations in the United States has only increased the complexity of compliance.     Over time MedImpact has extensively invested in systems to meet the needs of clients and regulators. These systems were built using traditional website techniques and effectively met current needs. However, as more and more client sites were desired, along with the need for supporting new regulatory and market requirements, it became apparent that a different approach was needed.     Resolution     After extensive evaluation and research, MedImpact picked Liferay Portal as the base platform for new development and delivery of access to existing systems. MedImpact found the Liferay Portal framework to be a solid, industry standard and scalable solution that easily met the needs of the organization. Liferay scales well both in terms of performance but also in terms of operational self-service and eases the burden on IT. In addition, MedImpact selected Xtivia, Inc. to help guide and accelerate integration of the portal into these environments. The goal was to develop a portal strategy that could be easily replicated across many sites providing self-service content management to the business users and saving on costly IT labor.     Before engaging Xtivia, MedImpact diligently prepared plans for Liferay deployment and sent several people to Liferay training. This detailed preparation was essential. Even with this advanced preparation, the Xtivia initial assessment identified more than 25 topics for discussion, development, and resolution. The two companies worked together on these items during the engagement with an emphasis on mentoring and ongoing knowledge transfer.     Much of the work focused on centralized authentication and authorization control, provision of custom look and feel, and architecting a pattern for future sites. Some of the more detailed highlights include:           Design and implement Single Sign-on (SSO)      Integrate existing applications into portal with SSO      Integrate LDAP into Liferay with ongoing LDAP user and group data synchronization to Liferay      Develop a comprehensive test suite and perform end-to-end SSO testing      Develop login portlet and autologin filters      Implement custom portlets and custom theme styling      Leverage velocity templates to create dynamic web content          Finally, Xtivia provided advice in many different areas, ranging from short-term \"do it this way\" through long term planning and direction. For instance, Xtivia advised on the configuration of development, QA, staging, and production environments, as well as the performance tuning of the production cluster. Xtivia provided MedImpact with the professional experience needed from their lessons learned over many engagements and deployments.     The team also developed plans for future deployment and replication of environments. All this was done in a way to effectively transfer knowledge to MedImpact.     Business Value Added     MedImpact expects the Liferay Portal solution to accomplish long-term outcomes for the PBM provider. As MedImpact moves all current web properties to Liferay, our Compliance, Marketing and Client Engagement teams can create and modify content and submit it for approval. This results in lower operational costs in the areas of new private-label sites and maintenance of current sites because, prior to Liferay, site content management required expensive IT software engineering resources to implement compliance and marketing content changes.     MedImpact has plans to migrate all of its web portal technology to Liferay in the near future.","keywords":["MedImpact HealthCare Systems, Inc.","Liferay Portal","Pharmacy Benefit Manager","drug benefit management","management","nation","interests","revenue","drug fulfillment","PBM","systems","health plans","health plans","Clients","care pharmacy","members","care organizations","state","organization","information technology","employers","employers","nation","partners","pharmacy benefit management services","human capital","practice","hospitals","administrators","insurance carriers","unions","corporations","combination","environments","company","program","programs","strategy","Finally","client sites","employee programs","health management system","benefit programs","people","organizations","members","member websites","website","members","pharmacy benefits","operations center","Prescription Drug Benefit Plans","team","terms","call","offices","portal","hundreds","terms","compliance","complexity","offerings","cash discount cards","example","tools","spending accounts","operations staff","features","plans","systems","benefit programs","industry standard","site content management","terms","sites","clients","needs","need","development","needs","organization","state","needs","self-service","website techniques","regulators","Resolution","regulations","healthcare regulations","development","preparation","IT","environments","deployment","approach","solution","performance","addition","people","instance","standards","Xtivia, Inc.","self-service content management","planning","plans","integration","addition","business users","discussion","preparation","goal","market requirements","access","delivery","base platform","research","evaluation","framework","Tempe","spectrum","variability","face","eligibility","enrollment","disenrollment","language","disabilities","Section","way","development","burden","IT labor","training","topics","assessment","Ariz","Calif.","San Diego","websites","deployments","engagements","deployment","Xtivia","United States","areas","velocity templates","instance","production","knowledge","way","guidelines","plans","content","Compliance","sites","compliance","sites","Leverage","styling","theme","direction","configuration","performance tuning","production cluster","lessons","experience","replication","Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services","Business Value","Xtivia","Marketing","web portal technology","all","Rehabilitation Act","data synchronization","provider","approval","Client Engagement teams","areas","advice","portal","SSO testing Develop login portlet","portlets","outcomes","web properties","results","costs","marketing content changes","maintenance","companies","sites","control","QA","resolution","engagement","SSO","solution","Some","authorization","provision","authentication","user","knowledge transfer","items","emphasis","mentoring","look","work","Much","pattern","autologin filters","test suite","group","applications","highlights","IT software engineering resources","LDAP","SSO Integrate LDAP","Single Sign-on"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=raiffeisen-bank-zrt-","text":"Raiffeisen Bank Zrt. is one of the leading financial institutions in Hungary and serves corporate and retail customers as well as municipalities with a full range of banking services. The bank serves more than 600,000 retail customers including private individuals and small businesses through its general retail banking services. Raiffeisen Bank's tailor-made solutions for its Premium Banking customers address needs in financial security, investment portfolio planning, retirement, borrowing and insurance. The Corporate Banking Department serves more than 6,000 clients at 25 branches throughout the country in the areas of corporate banking and specialized lending.   Challenge     Faced with an aging customer support portal, Raiffeisen Bank Zrt. sought a new and modern web content management system and portal solution that would accelerate its business processes and involved minimal day-to-day maintenance. The bank faced the challenge of finding a solution that would provide web content management functions such as integration, SEO and content approval processes support. In addition, the new system was desired to adapt to the already existing banking infrastructure with easy content migration and management processes in place.     Resolution     Raiffeisen Bank examined many open source portal solutions including Java- and PHP- based systems and narrowed its search to Liferay Portal and another Java technology-based portal. Following tests on speed, technology and the level of ease involved in creating the main page of Raiffeisen.hu portal, the bank chose Liferay Portal to replace its old solution.     The Raiffeisen Bank team favored the CMS system in Liferay Portal over competing products for its open source nature, cluster opportunities, Java-based framework with JSR portlet standard support, easy-to-add applications, well-developed permission handling system, support for popular repositories, out-of-the-box applications that are easy to customize, and rich content management tools. The bank also found in Liferay Portal a solution that provided an array of convenient content management features such as drag-and-drop portlet entity publication, web content structures and templates that could be edited from the admin interface, categorization, staging, content versioning, content publication scheduling, a role-based permission handling system and a workflow engine.     Raiffeisen Bank was able to build a solution quickly on the Liferay platform that followed existing standards and provided an improvement to the bank's web appearance. The structure and content of the pages were easy to edit, leading to quick responses to business needs. The static contents were replaced with dynamic solutions, which facilitated the content publication process. Using Liferay Portal, the bank was able to give meta information on each page, which helps the search optimization process.     The project was implemented by Webtown-Informatika Kft., a Liferay partner.     Business Value Added     The new portal framework allows Raiffeisen to react instantly to business needs that are critical in the ever-changing financial market. With support from Liferay Portal's pre- assembled templates and efficient CMS system, the bank is now able to easily produce the required campaign micro sites for online marketing activities within a couple of days.     Raiffeisen has also been able to achieve content management and scalability on each of these pages regarding the SEO through Liferay Portal functionalities such as the search friendly URLs or using the page level metadata associations.     From the beginning, Raiffeisen put an emphasis on considering the Liferay structure and to follow the pre-established CMS system regulation. Thus, the bank was able to create a very stable framework that could be operated easily and with very little intervention.","keywords":["Raiffeisen Bank Zrt.","bank","Liferay Portal","web content management system","customers","one","solution","banking services","content management tools","municipalities","institutions","range","solutions","SEO","bank","businesses","customers","customers","Premium Banking","needs","Hungary","retail banking services","investment portfolio planning","insurance","borrowing","retirement","security","solution","banking","Challenge","bank","customer support portal","templates","individuals","framework","team","solution","bank","system","business processes","portal","page","content","portal","bank","portal framework","processes","challenge","project","solution","permission handling system","CMS system","solutions","systems","permission handling system","clients","branches","lending","areas","country","management","maintenance","page","Corporate Banking Department","processes","support","portlet standard support","web content management functions","framework","integration","search","bank","web content structures","drag-and-drop portlet entity publication","admin interface","applications","level","technology","CMS system","campaign micro sites","cluster opportunities","repositories","nature","products","approval","addition","place","content migration","banking infrastructure","Resolution","tests","speed","ease","solutions","support","content versioning","content management features","categorization","workflow engine","content publication scheduling","staging","Business Value","business needs","solution","Java","market","templates","bank","content management","array","partner","marketing activities","pages","bank","structure","intervention","JSR","content","contents","functionalities","each","page level metadata associations","scalability","emphasis","beginning","CMS system regulation","pages","content publication process","search optimization process","Webtown-Informatika Kft.","business needs","standards","web appearance","platform","responses","URLs","information","improvement","structure"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=raiffeisen-bank","text":"Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d. Zagreb (RBA) was founded in 1994 by Austrian Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG (RZB). Today, RBA's branch network gives it a presence in 37 cities throughout Croatia. The bank's mission is to build long-term relationships by providing contemporary financial services that effectively meet client needs to the highest professional standard.   Challenge     RBA communicates with a large number of retail and corporate clients on a daily basis. This results in a high volume of data processing from web content, documents and a variety of other channels available to clients. As new data is created across the bank's diverse business units, it enters a workflow from submission to approval to publishing. RBA's challenge was not only to streamline this process, but also to ensure that all content was of consistent quality and adhered to corporate guidelines. RBA needed to implement complex corporate standards according to visual templates provided by the group, and at the same time support the latest web technologies so the content would be accessible through different browsers and mobile devices.     The biggest technological challenge was to integrate a variety of applications that had originally been developed in isolation into one coherent system. RBA decided they needed a portal infrastructure to provide the adequate mechanisms for these functionalities to work together as one unified system.     Solution     RBA evaluated several portal solutions, but none of them were able to meet business demands while keeping implementation and administration simple. Liferay offered both, as well as a strong community as three other Raiffeisen entities in the Central and Eastern European region were successfully using Liferay. Key features that led to its selection included its robust CMS system, affordable subscription model and source code availability.     Liferay's use of portlets simplified the complex task of meeting both business and graphical requirements by unifying all the data workflow steps: content creation, modification, approval, publishing and presentation. As well as meeting existing requirements, Liferay opened up new possibilities for ongoing innovation. It proved to be a solid platform for building new custom components as needed, ultimately presenting specific information in an optimal, customized manner for the end user.     The implementation was carried out by Liferay service partner CROZ, with whom RBA had previously cooperated on multiple projects. CROZ's expert analyzed RBA's existing proprietary technology, outlined their business and technological needs, and highlighted new functionalities and features that could be utilized by implementing Liferay.     Business Value Added     Adopting an open source technology brought immediate business benefits, including cost savings and the ability to take an agile development approach. RBA now use Liferay to power one holistic, multisite platform that lays the groundwork for developing new group member portals. Each new portal is consistent and aligned according to group-wide branding standards.     Not only does the new platform enable the bank to innovate for its customers, but RBA has also introduced new features to benefit its internal teams as well. Processes which were historically manual and therefore error prone have now been automated, such as document archiving. This feature enables content administrators to upload documents with predefined publish and expiration dates. Documents are only available during the defined period, after which time they are renamed and archived. Automating this process saves RBA significant amounts of time and resources.     Historic bottlenecks in the IT department have also been eliminated. RBA used Liferay's content publishing features to build a new publishing process that equips the business user to publish content and does not require a separate department's involvement. The simplification of this process brought much needed agility and flexibility to content management. Optimizing technology, efficiency and business processes have been key results of RBA's successful Liferay implementation.","keywords":["Solution RBA","Liferay","services","clients","features","relationships","branch network","Raiffeisenbank","Austria","documents","standard","client","bank","Challenge","applications","mission","cities","number","retail","basis","results","presence","content","Austrian","web content","Zagreb","CROZ","Croatia","data processing","process","challenge","community","implementation","documents","content","publishing","possibilities","approval","bank","standards","content publishing","Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG","variety","workflow","data","business","components","channels","volume","submission","business units","quality","guidelines","templates","feature","platform","challenge","group","web technologies","platform","publishing process","system","portlets","system","system","publishing","technology","features","Processes","approval","administration","requirements","implementation","variety","functionalities","solutions","process","presentation","requirements","end user","business demands","region","entities","source code availability","subscription model","selection","data workflow steps","use","task","content creation","browsers","devices","isolation","both","modification","innovation","information","manner","projects","expert","infrastructure","customers","content","mechanisms","process","business processes","bank","teams","error","document archiving","content administrators","technology","agility","CROZ","implementation","Eastern European","Central","CMS","IT department","department","business user","functionalities","business","amounts","resources","bottlenecks","flexibility","content management","efficiency","portal","none","approach","features","open source technology","groundwork","business benefits","Business Value","results","group member portals","platform","branding standards","simplification","needs","ability","development","involvement","cost savings"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=qad","text":"QAD is a leading provider of enterprise software and services designed for global manufacturing companies. Its IT group wanted to evolve its infrastructure to be an integrated platform that connected all of its sites, including a public website and an external user community. The IT group was faced with the challenge of meeting diverse site requirements from marketing, sales and engineering. They had experience in the past with using a combination of disparate solutions and knew that this time, they wanted a single solution to bring it all together.   The team made the decision to commit to an open source Java solution. After reviewing industry analyst recommendations, Liferay was chosen as the new platform. Liferay offered an IT infrastructure that would integrate QAD\u2019s intranet, public website and content management system.   \u201cI liked the technical foundation,\u201d said Bob Ward, IT Engineer for QAD. \u201cLiferay is easy to work with because it\u2019s familiar.\u201d   Tailored Solutions for the Entire Organization     The new solution wasn\u2019t just about choosing better software. Due to the changing nature of digital business, the IT team\u2019s role in the organization was evolving; more than managing technology, the team was tasked with understanding the needs of QAD\u2019s employees, customers and partners and providing tailored solutions to help them accomplish their goals.     They started with an online community forum and saw an immediate increase in participation from internal and external users. Encouraged by the successful launch, they expanded Liferay into QAD\u2019s public website and customer portal.     QAD\u2019s intranet had custom development requirements and aimed to provide employees with a one-stop location to find the tools and content required for their jobs. Using Liferay as an application platform, the IT team additionally built a utility site with 15 plugins which offer a wide range of features from application, system and network availability to room reservations and a request portal for employees that require new hardware or software.     Paving the Way to Greater Personalization     Six years after the switch, QAD continues to use Liferay. The platform consistently delivers a level of performance that meets QAD\u2019s high IT standards with a flexibility that allows the IT team to continue evolving each project, no matter what new requirements they meet.     Recently, the team implemented a strategy to provide greater personalization to their customers on support.qad.com. The goal was to provide a dashboard on the account home page that was tailored to each user\u2019s needs and preferences, based on the profile they created when they first made an account. Liferay\u2019s Audience Targeting module provided a good alternative to custom code, which would have been costly to maintain as the project evolved.     QAD created customer segments based on key attributes (job role, install type, etc.) and used Audience Targeting to vary displays for each group. On the front end, this means that the customer sees different sets of icons for common functions that they\u2019ll use. On the back end, the site is pulling customer data from multiple disparate sources. There are eight different dashboards that QAD manages, and the IT team is able to automatically set the default view to whatever seems most appropriate to each customer.     This method of personalization enabled rapid releases of new features and improved customer experience. QAD\u2019s future plans for audience targeting include aggregating more customer data for a 360 view of customers, improving messaging and communications, targeting content through personalized messages based on what is not included in customer profiles (e.g. \u201cYou haven\u2019t updated your profile in some time.\u201d) and hardening the infrastructure to grow capacity.     \u201cThe biggest reason to recommend Liferay is its ability to execute,\u201d Ward said. \u201cAt the end of the day, my career depends on IT performance.\u201d Liferay\u2019s solid technical foundation has helped QAD establish a platform that will evolve along with IT\u2019s role in the organization.","keywords":["QAD","Liferay","platform","IT","solution","enterprise software","Bob Ward","Organization","manufacturing companies","services","level","employees","IT team","solutions","employees","sites","site requirements","infrastructure","IT group","user community","IT group","engineering","experience","plugins","combination","all","challenge","sales","marketing","team","website","ability","account home page","team","platform","utility site","solution","Solutions","platform","dashboards","foundation","customers","website","IT infrastructure","customers","content management system","intranet","solution","tools","team","IT team","decision","software","application platform","development requirements","IT team","customer","customers","website","content","software","intranet","role","users","industry analyst recommendations","requirements","goal","user","customer portal","features","application","system","request portal","solutions","partners","needs","goals","participation","method","project","performance","needs","location","jobs","room reservations","network availability","Way","business","technology","nature","increase","community forum","launch","range","foundation","switch","flexibility","matter","IT standards","strategy","preferences","Java","personalization","back end","personalization","content","communications","audience targeting","site","plans","dashboard","customer data","sources","view","features","customer experience","customer data","view","messaging","sets","Greater Personalization Six","platform","customer profiles","profile","infrastructure","organization","role","releases","icons","customer","messages","IT performance","support.qad.com","hardware","capacity","career","Audience Targeting","profile","group","job role","end","account","project","Audience Targeting module","code","install type","displays","attributes","customer segments","functions","alternative"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=azul-linhas-aereas","text":"Azul Linhas A\u00e9reas Brasileiras, the third largest airline company in Brazil, in 2012 created an innovative relationship program on the Liferay platform. Before moving to Liferay Portal, the frequent flyer program, TudoAzul, which currently has over 2 million customers, had been challenged by the volume of hits and struggled to gain visibility and recognition in its market.   Challenge     Creating a Customer Portal like TudoAzul was a big challenge because besides requiring multiple functionalities, there was a large volume of data that needed to be integrated and managed. Because it is a B2C accessed by millions of users, security, stability and scalability were key requirements. The management of confidential information generated more responsibility as well as personal data, information on credits, and vouchers, among other applications available through the portal.     It is also important to mention that managing the relationship with the client on the portal was a major challenge. In addition to raising customer awareness of the existence of the portal, Azul sought a solution in which the customer felt at ease when navigating the site.     In addition to all matters relating to clients, it was important to consider the employees who would manage portal content. Therefore, any organizational changes that the implementation of a new tool would bring was an item that was taken very seriously.     Solution     Workflow functionality, Drag and Drop, among others, make Liferay Portal easy to use and its implementation was well accepted by the staff of Azul.

Priceline.com needed a solution that would continually provide easy access to up-to-date hotel contact information without creating additional IT costs for its hotel partners.     Resolution     Priceline.com decided to create a communications channel for all of its hotel partners that also acts as the central location for managing partner activities. Liferay was selected as the platform for this initiative because of its robustness in features and customizable open-source nature. In addition, Liferay contained a complex hierarchy of permission and an API\/SOAP interface that supported bulk-load users and organizations. \"Being open source and having the ability to customize were, by far, Liferay's most important features,\" said Greg Horne, VP, Corporate Information Systems at Priceline.com. \"The Liferay solution provides our partners with a single location where all partner activity and function points can be managed, and also functions as the consolidated communication channel for all of our hotel partners.\" Using Liferay, Priceline.com's IT team created a portlet with the enhanced ability to allow a registered hotel partner to remotely change authorized users. Priceline.com employees monitor and validate all change requests, making the adjustments to a backend database. Liferay supports the front end of the updating process. In addition, using Liferay's document management capabilities, Priceline.com created a one-stop document repository that answers even the most obscure questions reported by its base of external partners. Partners can access large data feed files, execute interactive reports, review static legacy reports and read procedural documents.     Business Value Added     Priceline.com expects to reap cost benefit savings with its new communications channel built on Liferay as the company retires older legacy systems.","keywords":["Priceline.com","Liferay","price","hotels","consumers","consumers","access","Name Your Own Price","world","basis","hotel partners","hotel reservations","all","foundation","location","partner hotels","Greg Horne","Employee turnover","contacts","challenge","lists","hotel industry","solution","communications channel","access","partners","partners","features","addition","users","source","IT costs","hotel contact information","partner activities","location","Corporate Information Systems","partner activity","solution","robustness","nature","SOAP","hierarchy","permission","organizations","interface","initiative","platform","features","function points","document repository","Partners","adjustments","backend database","addition","documents","document management capabilities","end","updating process","questions","base","communications channel","Business Value","reports","API","legacy systems","hotel partner","hotel partners","ability","legacy reports","data feed files","company","cost benefit savings","employees","communication channel","ability","users","IT team","portlet","change requests"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=osaka-gas","text":"Osaka Gas is a leading energy supplier with its core natural gas supply business serving nearly 7 million customers in Japan's Kansai region. With a portfolio of diversified energy businesses, Osaka Gas is developing into a multi-energy services provider of natural gas, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), district heating and cooling, and other services. Including its affiliated enterprises, the Osaka Gas Group is also active in various non-energy business fields.   Challenge     With its various business units and diverse portfolio of services, Osaka Gas was faced with the challenge of managing an abundance of data. The company's intranet aggregated not just content but a number of disparate applications, and it relied on a well-known commercial product portal system to do so. Over the course of eight years, however, users began to voice frustrations with the portal. Certain applications slowed the system, often leading to tedious reboots twice a week during business hours. Business users also complained about the abundance of links, which made it difficult to view information in a quick and simple way.     As it neared the end of its service contract, Osaka Gas was presented with two options. One was to improve the current system, which would involve either an upgrade to a newer version of the portal or a potentially expensive scale-up of its hardware. Since this commercial portal was tied to an enterprise suite of products, the upgrade did not appear to be a practical option as it would necessitate the replacement of the entire suite at once, which involved huge risk. Scaling was not a better option, either. Due to interdependencies with the hardware and operating system, Osaka Gas was reliant on installing hardware that had become out of date over time and eventually phased out of production.     Resolution     One last option was to replace the portal system. While this also involved some level of risk, with concerns about stability and cost, Liferay surfaced as an attractive and viable solution. As an open source product, Liferay would provide access to the source code as well as implementation resources; at a tenth of the price of most competitors, any questions regarding operational and management costs would also be laid to rest. After much deliberation, it was decided that replacing their system with Liferay Portal would be the best alternative.     As the primary integrator, Osaka Gas Information System Research Institute (OGIS) focused on integrating the Liferay cluster system and evaluating any possible fits and gaps between Liferay and the previous portal system. They were also tasked with installing the original portlets and assuming daily operations and maintenance.     Since Osaka Gas hosts over 25,000 enterprise users, it was wary of major overhauls to the user interface. Fortunately, Liferay's flexible theming solutions and adherence to open standards like JSR-168 allowed the company to update the back-end system with minimal disruption to user experience. What's more, open source software allowed them the stability they had previously lacked. \"Our main goals were to achieve greater reliability and better cost management. Liferay accomplished that resoundingly,\" said Shigeru Nonami, Manager of Information & Communication Systems.     Osaka Gas is now reaping the benefits of Liferay Portal on a daily basis. Users are touting the utility derived from features such as granular management of roles and authorizations (pages and portlets), easy page layout customization, and ease of integration between Liferay and the company's original collaboration systems (BBS, Scheduler) via Web Services. Osaka Gas is now able to quickly scale this intranet (and intra-organization communication) to give its family of subsidiary companies direct access to information as well.

The TST's primary function is to standardize the Brazilian labor law.   Challenge     In 2011, TST decided that it required a portal that allowed migration to a more modern platform. The former portal lacked in informational and visual identification, while duplicate pages and defective information architecture caused functional and strategic problems. Missing and unnecessary information created complications in content management as well as migration.     The TST portal was largely controlled in HTML, causing difficulties in updating and managing content. The lack of an internal process to manage web tools further aggravated the problem. The decentralization of management complicated the overall process. Katia Knychala, the Judiciary and System Analyst of the TST, explained that it was also unknown who was managing each content.     Resolution     Investigation revealed several failures in the portal's content management. After identifying the content system integrator and Liferay partner, Sea Tecnologia, rated it with regard to the degree of relevance. Sea also guided the information hierarchy and provided priority to delivery in respect to significance. These steps resulted in clear identification and removal of any unnecessary, duplicated pages. An information architecture was then developed based on the overlooked format, and conceptual and emotional maps were drawn to create the first wireframes.     After, an interface with Liferay was generated. Liferay greatly simplified content management problems as well as the content recovery and editing processes of TST. New navigation tools were implemented to improve the organization of information, and content manager identification was made possible to ensure timely deliveries. The interface with Liferay simplified content management on both the intranet and Internet, increasing efficiency and effectiveness in TST's workflow. Not only did Liferay resolve TST's problems in content management and information organization, but it allows TST to easily create customizable pages such as blogs and RSS.","keywords":["jurisdiction","territories","nation","DF","Brasilia","Superior Labor Court","function","interface","pages","Liferay","labor law","Challenge","content management","Brazilian","content management","information","portal","problems","navigation tools","identification","content","content","Katia Knychala","migration","information architecture","content management","management","platform","complications","process","portal","content system integrator","portal","problem","process","identification","migration","web tools","delivery","information","difficulties","lack","decentralization","content manager identification","portal","partner","relevance","degree","regard","information hierarchy","respect","significance","steps","removal","editing processes","failures","deliveries","organization","priority","content recovery","Internet","Sea Tecnologia","pages","Judiciary","Resolution Investigation","HTML","problems","information organization","intranet","efficiency","effectiveness","workflow","blogs","content management problems","pages","information architecture","format","wireframes","maps","RSS"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=ubm","text":"United Business Media Information (UBMi) is a global leader in media and publishing, known for delivering integrated media solutions to approximately 20 international industry sectors.

Upon its arrival, VIPnet introduced competition into mobile telephony in Croatia, which led to competitive prices and a rise in the quality of services for the country's telecommunications market. The penetration rate in Croatia when VIPnet entered the market represented just 4.6 percent, but by the end of 2011, it had reached 117.5 percent. VIPnet was highly successful against the existing mobile operator in Croatia and, as a result, is known for having the best market entrance of a second GSM operator in Europe ever.   In August 2011, VIPnet acquired B.net, the largest Croatian cable operator that offers fixed telephony, broadband Internet access and television services; by the end of the first quarter in 2012, VIPnet counted almost 2 million customers. VIPnet is part of the Telekom Austria Group and is a strategic partner of Vodafone, the leading global mobile operator.   Challenge     In 2008, VIPnet's portal system was a standalone, decentralized system with many uniquely working functions, high dependence on vendors, no possibility of reusing modules and many different ways of development and deployment.     VIPnet looked for a portal that could act as a container for all of its stand-alone applications. In addition, the mobile operator sought to move all of VIPnet's legacy applications to the new portal, to have continuous development and to standardize its portal solution within the group.     Resolution     During the selection process VIPnet had examined various vendors such as IBM, Liferay, Oracle, JBoss, and Exo, among others. The criteria included a fast and easy-to-handle portal that would facilitate user awareness, community building, blogging, the integration of new features, SEO, content editing and improved stability. After a thorough examination against the company's needs, VIPnet chose Liferay.     Key factors leading to the decision to use Liferay Portal were the open source portal's references, Java-based framework with JSR portlet standard support, flexibility with different operating systems, vendor independence, scalability, easy integration with Oracle DBs, and its use as a portlet container from which all the applications a user needed could run.     VIPnet plans to put all of its stand-alone applications on Liferay by 2014, develop mobile sites based on Liferay for the VIPnet and Tomato brand, and create a new web and mobile site for B.net, the company's new acquisition.     Business Value Added     With over 450,000 users, the new portal framework gives VIPnet better leverage in a fast-paced telecommunications market. Particularly valuable are Web 2.0 features such as user awareness, community development, blogs, widget based presentation, improved stability, availability and faster loading. This also gives VIPnet engineers better insight and control over the software architecture and implementation, web services implementation by multiple vendors, and in-house implementation of web services.","keywords":["VIPnet","Croatia","operations","B.net","market","penetration rate","competition","all","mobile telephony","services","telecommunications market","Challenge","stability","prices","country","quality","rise","arrival","portal","Liferay","mobile operator","GSM operator","Vodafone","telephony","portal","portal","mobile operator","market entrance","result","broadband Internet access","part","partner","applications","container","legacy applications","all","television services","vendors","portal framework","development","portal system","development","vendors","integration","group","Business Value","criteria","features","blogging","user awareness","deployment","possibility","modules","ways","solution","addition","Resolution","customers","dependence","functions","applications","web","users","others","selection process","community building","SEO","content editing","examination","Europe","company","site","sites","features","brand","acquisition","Telekom Austria Group","telecommunications market","vendors","web services","control","Oracle","community development","implementation","web services implementation","implementation","user awareness","blogs","IBM","JBoss","Exo","leverage","engineers","presentation","availability","loading","software architecture","open source portal","references","Tomato","user","applications","portlet container","Web 2.0","company","operating systems","integration","insight","framework","needs","scalability","vendor independence","flexibility","portlet standard support","decision","use","Oracle DBs","Java","JSR"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=universidad-del-pais-vasco","text":"The University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU) is the largest of the Basque Country and one of the largest universities in Spain in terms of degrees and university students.

It runs a multi-modal transport system made up of urban and regional buses, together with a rail network and a funicular railway. Because the system is so versatile, the whole area covered by the canton of Freiburg, part of the Broye district and those regions of the Vaud canton that border the lakes can be serviced, and the various forms of transport can be harmonised. With nearly 29 million passengers, turnover that has increased by more than Fr.134 million, a 10% increase in services as well as the development of a whole range of new ones intended to make transport safe, fast and appealing (by reducing journey times and reducing congestion on major roads), TPF has had a good year!   The company is one of the canton's largest employers: 800 employees work across its various sites.   Challenge     In 2011, the company set itself a number of new targets to keep pace with changes in its sector and so decided to overhaul its website. It was around ten years old and its rather inflexible design meant that it could not evolve. The company needed to update its image in the eyes of the general public and increase its selection of on-line services. Especially since the canton of Freiburg had to rise to the challenge of geographic mobility. \"We were aware that the  www.tpf.ch  website effectively showcased the transport network and was the ideal communications channel for keeping the general public informed\", said Gr\u00e9goire Ramuz, TPF's Director of IT. Also, the IT Department wanted to make the company's different departments autonomous so that it could concentrate on added-value tasks and reduce its operating costs. It therefore decided to issue a public invitation to tender \u2013 which Liferay won out of around ten other bidding companies.      DECISION AND ADDED VALUE FOR THE COMPANY     Liferay's criteria for flexibility and sturdiness gained support. The solution is stable and upgradable and features a number of native features, including the ability to manage several different languages \u2013 an essential prerequisite in the canton of Freiburg which is on the border between Switzerland's French-speaking and German-speaking regions. And the aim of providing the various business lines with greater autonomy has been met: they can make their own updates to the site and create new pages \u2013 all from a single screen. Content is natively indexed by Liferay, making the search engine more effective. Furthermore, the site is an example of \"Responsive Design\", meaning that it provides an optimal viewing experience on tablets and smartphones \u2013 evidence of just how modern it is.     After some in-house training, users have quickly been able to get the hang of it. They mainly use the new site's native features and don't have to call on IT support.     Liferay also manages the social networks and the information screens in the canton'svarious stations, updating them in the event of disruptions.     Updates to the site will mainly focus on two key aspects. Firstly, information being published in real-time so that passengers can access added-value services (times, traffic information, journey search features, etc.), and secondly, a travel card management feature provided by Liferay. The aim will be to enable travel card holders to renew and pay for their travel cards on-line without their having to visit a station.

Overcoming User Dissatisfaction and Disjointed Portal Web Sites     VMware\u2019s previously existing customer portal faced challenges in terms of infrastructure and site usability. Bringing together legacy technology on different platforms was difficult. Additionally, regular customer satisfaction surveys and indicators from external VMware websites brought to light that users were dissatisfied with features of the existing portal interface and navigation. At times, customers had to navigate to different sites and log in multiple times. There was not always a single location for all the information they needed.     VMware selected Liferay, the leading open source enterprise portal in the market, as the foundation for a new customer portal. To address its technical challenges and meet customer expectations, VMware sought to achieve these strategic objectives:           Consolidate legacy technology portals across different platforms.      Increase flexibility and optimize time management with a modular, plug-and-play approach for adding new portals and integrating existing portals.

The company was looking for a new platform for its product VantagePoint, a business services portal that integrates disparate enterprise systems, turning data into a unified, real-time and personalized dashboard that is customized for end users based on their roles.   The portal technologies that Unisys had tried in the past were either too expensive or proprietary. The company wanted to make a shift to open source in order to take advantage of its lower cost and standards-based technology. In addition, the new solution needed to have powerful integration features and be configurable for different clients. After a review of options, Unisys chose Liferay for its multitenancy capabilities, customizable UI and flexibility.   \u201cThe best news I ever received was when I found out I could do persona-based computing,\u201d said Richard Phelps, the Global Director of User Experience at Unisys. \u201cIndividual users are trying to perform very specific job functions, and we had the ability to help them with Liferay.\u201d   Compelling Customer Experience Powered by Open Source     One of the first successes Unisys saw with Liferay was significant cost savings through multitenancy. The company supports about 70 clients on a single Liferay license, accounting for 6,000 unique interactions each day. Other solutions required a license fee per user, resulting in more than 10x the cost per client.     In moving VantagePoint to Liferay, Unisys aimed to create an intuitive and personalized user interface for its customers. The company used Liferay\u2019s modularity to design a card-based dashboard with the ability to create personas and views with aggregated data that is useful to individual users, based on their role in the enterprise. Its purpose is to give people the ability to see if everything is going well at a glance. \u201cThe ability to go from \u2018It\u2019s broken\u2019 to \u2018Here\u2019s why\u2019 in two clicks is really one of the greatest innovations,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cEvery client we show it to wants it.\u201d With the new front end, VantagePoint is turning out to be a primary differentiator for Unisys.     VantagePoint has more than a compelling user experience. The company primarily uses Liferay as an application integration platform, and its flexibility makes it fast and easy to add new applications as needed. Currently, VantagePoint integrates 6 \u2013 7 applications, and the company has plans to add more in the future, including facilities crisis management, stealth technology, security management and mobile environment management.     One Solution for 3,000+ Mobile Configurations     Another key benefit of the Liferay platform was its move to responsive web design. As a company that serves enterprises, Unisys has no control of what end users have in their hands. They need to account for every combination of mobile technology \u2014 more than 3,000 combinations of devices and operating systems. This isn\u2019t a problem that could be solved one device at a time with apps. Liferay\u2019s responsive web design makes it easy to adapt to the environment and the device, which really made a difference in Unisys\u2019s mobile approach. Now, the VantagePoint dashboard adapts to any screen \u2014 desktop, tablet or smartphone \u2014 to deliver real-time views of what\u2019s happening across people, operations and the business.     A Winning Combination     Unisys often receives requests from other solution providers to look at their technology, but they haven\u2019t seen anything on the market like Liferay. People see the VantagePoint dashboard and assume that it simply takes data from a common source and displays it. But it\u2019s really the powerful back-end integration that makes Liferay so valuable. The combination of an excellent user experience and the technological capability to deliver the best services are what makes VantagePoint a differentiator for Unisys.     \u201cWe would not be doing what we\u2019re doing today if it wasn\u2019t for Liferay,\u201d Phelps said.","keywords":["Unisys","VantagePoint","users","Liferay","Richard Phelps","company","end users","companies","enterprise solutions","many","world","company","technologies","dashboard","platform","roles","enterprise systems","ability","data","order","source","ability","requests","computing","shift","data","solutions","company","end users","technology","solution","company","clients","User Experience","cost","company","Solution","integration","company","advantage","flexibility","multitenancy capabilities","news","user","one","Customer Experience","addition","options","review","UI","dashboard","integration features","user interface","interactions","differentiator","company","everything","dashboard","enterprise","ability","clients","client","people","cost","client","end","user experience","more","purpose","application integration platform","applications","customers","applications","role","views","personas","multitenancy","license","cost savings","modularity","flexibility","glance","clicks","job functions","successes","problem","technology","Combination","innovations","plans","Global","device","difference","device","people","environment","web design","views","business","operations","Phelps","Open Source One","apps","approach","desktop","screen","tablet","smartphone","solution providers","data","dashboard","user experience","combination","source","differentiator","capability","services","license fee","anything","market","stealth technology","mobile technology","enterprises","combinations","combination","security management","environment management","platform","devices","web design","operating systems","People","benefit","Configurations","hands","control","facilities crisis management"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=besafe-technologies","text":"BeSafe's services aid police, fire, EMT, SWAT and other emergency response personnel before and during intense emergency situations with immediate, detailed information like floor plans, photos and unique building features.

Challenge     The portal used by the Brazilian Army lacked in visual consistency and security, which affected the accessibility and usability of its pages. Military officials felt poorly represented by the disorganized model which also created huge inefficiencies in communication.     The Brazilian Army needed an internal system that ensured confidentiality and security in communication channels. Its former model did not support digital content management, causing officials to rely on analogue media such as print copies. These difficulties in content editing and management resulted in lost productivity. It was clear that the Brazilian Army required a portal that could provide content security and an easy-to-use communication system while transforming the overall layout of the portal.     Resolution     The Brazilian Army partnered with system integrator and Liferay partner, Sea Tecnologia for a portal modernization plan. Capturing the military persona of the Brazilian Army, Sea also designed an information architecture specifically to simplify navigation through visual consistency. An internal communication system was exclusively developed by Sea to ensure content security between the barracks. This portlet, called the Resiscomsex, provides priority confidentiality for data exchange between officials. With the help of Liferay, content management and editing was greatly simplified. Its ease of administration and straightforward approach to content management decentralized the process and allowed users to create and edit content without prior knowledge of HTML or experience in specialist areas.     All sites that did not seem connected to the matrix were changed, thereby generating a consistent hierarchy, where the Army's Portal covers all its branches, increasing its number of visits, leveraged by the people who previously only visited the aggregated pages, without understanding that they were part of a single set.     Today, the Brazilian Army demonstrates a more efficient means of communication and a more unified external image and internal system of management. Though in the past, content was managed analogically, Resiscomex and Liferay streamlined the overall process, increasing the productivity and autonomy of its platform and enabling militia-wide task management.","keywords":["Brazilian Army","consistency","country","country","officials","one","powers","operations","defense","law and order","portal","Brazil","Armed Forces","model","Challenge","content management","model","communication","security","security","people","system","hierarchy","pages","confidentiality","Liferay","accessibility","usability","content management","inefficiencies","management","communication channels","communication system","portal","communication system","portlet","content security","officials","partner","productivity","content editing","editing","pages","content security","layout","Resolution","system integrator","modernization plan","military persona","information architecture","print copies","media","difficulties","navigation","barracks","data exchange","help","priority confidentiality","Portal","part","content","Sea","Resiscomsex","management","portal","sites","number","visits","set","communication","system","Sea","task management","Sea Tecnologia","process","productivity","content","image","means","autonomy","platform","branches","process","Resiscomex","specialist areas","experience","HTML","knowledge","users","approach","administration","ease","matrix"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=bristol-city-council","text":"With a population approaching 500,000 Bristol is the UK's 8th largest city. The city council, like most local authorities, has the difficult task of providing a broad range of services to a very diverse community. This task is made all the more difficult as budgets are squeezed and the pressure to optimise spending becomes ever greater.   Challenge     Bristol City Council recognises that the best and most cost efficient way to ensure continued access is by moving appropriate services to an online platform for all those who are able to consume them digitally. To achieve this goal the aim is to ensure that the level of digital service provided is so good, that people prefer to engage online.     The entire customer journey, end-to-end, needed to be tracked, analysed and reengineered. The aim was to allow both the user and the council's customer service staff to have a single view of the process and easily see what was required to complete the journey successfully. The underlying platform needed to be able to handle the level of transactions required and to do this securely and efficiently with a responsive customer service. It also needed to be flexible and feature rich, to meet the needs of its diverse customer base as well as those of the council and its staff. User interactions can originate from anywhere, so the service needed to be designed with the mobile user in mind. To this end a responsive design was implemented, that matched the user experience across multiple devices and gave a consistent user journey that might incorporate multiple devices in a single transaction.     Resolution     Bristol has spent time understanding these requirements and researched the market to find the best solution to meet them. It chose Liferay as the core of the digital services platform for its open standards design, open source flexibility and enterprise level support. Liferay provides the organising framework into which all new digital services are plugged. This service oriented approach, with loosely coupled systems, allows the council to optimise existing and legacy systems, whilst future proofing its ongoing strategy through an open framework ready for new technologies as they come along.     With the work on the foundation platform framework now complete, Bristol is able to start delivering in earnest on its channel shift approach by continuing to roll out new digital services at an increasing rate. Their decision to base this platform on Liferay is paying dividends as they begin to benefit from this strategy.           Safeguarding investment  \u2013 their open standards framework allows easy integration with existing systems and simplifies future application selection, as the open integration persists      Speed of delivery  \u2013 features such as the responsive design and native mobile capability, allow services to be built once, but effectively used in any environment      Cost savings  \u2013 using the freedom and interoperability of an open platform like Liferay to optimise any existing IT investment (technology agnostic), whilst also substantially reducing the cost that is intrinsic in traditional manual processes and service provision          Business Value Added     Ultimately Bristol City Council has a clear vision and strategy now on how best to meet the changing needs of the growing demands for high quality service provision and a reducing cost base. Meeting the needs of both the organisation and the community it serves.

It offers innovative programs that are responsive to the needs of adult learners and involve active, engaging, challenging, and relevant learning experiences offered in a variety of delivery modes. As a widely acknowledged leader in delivering high-quality education over the web, Capella was the first online university to be recognized by The Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for its work on student learning outcomes.   Challenge     As an institution that hosts all of its courses online, Capella University is heavily reliant on complex web-based systems that can help students and professors navigate university life. While much of this experience occurs within Capella's online course rooms, which are powered by the Blackboard learning management system (LMS), students also need access to resources like billing, course selection, and grades. Capella's portal, iGuide, also provides Capella's learners with essential support and academic content and tools for managing their academic career. When Capella implemented the PeopleSoft ERP system in 2007, it was able to deliver this portal functionality through PeopleSoft's built-in tools. While its ERP system is a valuable asset, Capella needed to enhance it with a portal and content management system (CMS) that allowed design flexibility and additional integrations.     It was determined that a new portal platform was needed to integrate all of Capella's technologies for a unified, personal, and intuitive user experience. Capella wanted the ability to create a state-of-the-art web experience instead of a generic portal look and feel. In other words, it was time for a richer user experience that would allow iGuide to become the virtual representation of the university that Capella had originally envisioned.     Resolution     Capella decided to enhance the essential core business functionality of the PeopleSoft ERP with a feature-rich, personalized web experience. After drafting some new criteria, Capella engaged a technical consulting firm to perform an unbiased evaluation of various portal technologies. Issues like flexibility, architecture, interface and content, user base vitality, and use (in total, over 40 different high-level criteria) were taken into account.     Although Capella considered many portal products, it chose Liferay Portal for its plethora of out-of-the-box features and social networking capabilities. The community and networking tools would help learners build academic and professional networks, as well as their own professional identities. The ability to integrate existing systems was also a key deciding factor, as Liferay's adherence to open standards allowed it to be easily integrated with PeopleSoft ERP.     Liferay's open integration capabilities have provided Capella a service-oriented architecture (SOA) layer that helps them access data. The most innovative and popular use of this technology is Capella's course dashboard, personalized for every learner, which uses web services to display real-time academic activity from the Blackboard course room directly onto the home page of the Liferay portal.     They have also implemented group-functionality that allows administrators to create groups for the school. Some are topical, while others are based on programs and interest groups. In addition, Capella was able to leverage Liferay's dynamic drag-and-drop feature to create the Degree Completion Plan, an interactive online environment that allows academic advisors to customize each learner's course of study by dragging and dropping courses and other elements in a webpage; it gives students on-demand access to their academic progress. Interactive designers and content managers have also been working to create new expanded user profiles, which would give students and staff their own virtual identities.     Today, Capella delivers a full university experience via the web. Learners in every degree program in all five of Capella's schools are now using the Liferay-based version of iGuide, which equates to nearly 40,000 users plus faculty and staff. The new portal is helping users access resources more easily and supporting them in their academic growth. Capella has also seen over 100,000 friend-relationships develop among their users through the Liferay-based networking tools.     Students have voiced their preference of the new site\u2014over 90 percent prefer the Liferay-based portal to the previous one. One student praised, \"The brain trust responsible for coming up with this idea needs to be rewarded. Thanks for thinking of us! I just wish this was here when I was just starting out.\" Another lauded, \"One word: Wow! I really enjoyed using this layout. It is much better than the older version in which everything was scattered about. Being new to online learning, I found this format to be much more user-friendly.\"     Looking ahead, Capella plans to implement additional features including faculty content and tools, more social media tools, built-in alerts and indicators, mobile versions of iGuide, enhanced tools and content for supporting learners, and enhanced partner pages (Capella's partners include large corporations for professional extension). As Capella continues to integrate and enhance web experiences for learners and faculty, Liferay will become even more integral to its systems. \"Liferay was the right choice to meet our needs,\" said Jason Scherschligt, Manager of Online User Experience. \"We needed a portal product that was reliable, scalable, very flexible, would deliver new features rapidly, and that included built-in CMS and social media tools.

It is the leading personal insurer in France and the 6th in Europe. CNP Assurances covers 14 million policyholders with life, savings and pension insurance, and 27 million with personal risk and protection policies. CNP Assurances employs 4,800 people worldwide. For 160 years, CNP Assurances has offered a full range of savings, pensions and personal risk insurance accommodating the needs of individuals and constant market changes. Its products are marketed through long-standing partnerships, in particular in France with Caisse d'\u00c9pargne and La Banque Postale.   The CNP Assurances Innovation and IS Impact Assessments team was created in 2011 to come under its Programmes and IS Department.The extremely flexible team of four is responsible for responding to the many and various demands of the different business units as well as from the Programmes and IS Department. In order to do so successfully, the team has created, developed or integrated only open-source solutions which are recognized, flexible, efficient and scalable. During a project's lifecycle, the team communicates with its internal \"customers\" by suggesting tailored, flexible project management practices. However, it also welcomes customer feedback.   It is with this background that CNP Assurances chose Liferay in 2009. A number of projects were considered, including one on the CNP Assurances products and processes knowledge-base.   Challenge     The \"Knowledge Base\" project presented a number of challenges. First of all, the existing base would have to be remodelled and its content, which had become difficult to manage, reorganized in order to direct the service to policyholders. This base contains approximately 350 insurance \"products\", 450 management procedures (with combined appendices totalling 14,000) and 5,000 attached files. All of this adds up to just over 15GB of data.     In total, there are 1,500 users who access the base daily and 2,000 occasional users. The second challenge lays in opening up access to CNP Assurances to external players so that they would be able to partially access information in the repository depending on their access rights.     There was also another challenge for the Innovation team: finding an innovative solution that met their flexibility and business efficiency requirements that also had a good cost to deadline ratio.     Resolution     There were several reasons CNP Assurances chose Liferay.     The product's flexibility was one. \"Business teams experience the project first-hand with us\", said Ludovic Andrieux, Project Manager for Innovation and IS Impact Assessments at CNP Assurances. \"It was essential that the project was guided by our customers right from the start. They became \"active participants\" in the project. Using the web portal, they were able to keep up with their changing needs, make improvements during the development phase, and customize the tool. For our part, we were able to support them thanks to practices that were flexible (cyclical development thanks to a feedback chain) and targeted\", stated Ludovic Andrieux.     We built the graphic interface easily, and the simple operational administration meant users could quickly get to grips with it. It was also easy to tackle other \"Design Thinking\" projects using the Liferay Portal.     \"As for the Innovation team, they found that, using Liferay, they could use their expertise to ensure accurate and appropriate encryption for customers. This confirmed its credibility with the Innovation team and with the Programmes and IS Department\", noted Fran\u00e7oise Hoyek, Innovation team manager.     Lastly, Liferay's compliance with standards meant it could integrate more effectively with the existing information system in a secure environment.     Implementing the Solution     Liferay Portal allows for subtle management of content depending on the different products of the user groups.     Each product has its own dedicated environment that authorized users can access to find all of the relevant information.     The Innovation team developed a specific function based on Liferay's application platform which allows each user to see who is in charge of a CNP Assurances contract for a given product, area or customer.     Furthermore, there is a forum where users can communicate. It can be accessed in just one click from the different elements of the page consulted on contract components, products or management procedures.     \"We haven't encountered any problems in the implementation phase\", Ludovic Andrieux pointed out.     Business Value Added     It boiled down to two key elements: ease of access and efficiency.     Business users were able to access more easily the information they were looking for. They liked the uncomplicated availability of content. As for the administrators, they were happy with the way content could be shared and with the fact that they found little disparity between their interfaces and those of business users.     \"We are satisfied with Liferay Portal solution\", affirmed Ludovic Andrieux. \"It allows us to quickly respond to our customers and we know we're sure to respond to their functional concerns in the time limits we've set for ourselves. This means we've been able to focus our development efforts on offering user-friendly online services and ensuring user acceptance. In addition, we are completely sold on the benefits open source brings to CNP Assurances. The extensive Liferay community allows us to develop products very quickly, which means that we can develop quickly too. We also like being able to share best practices. Furthermore, we rely on a collection of reusable components. Liferay is extremely scalable and can be adapted to projects of any size. Liferay Portal has completed the technological range we offer our customers.     \"In the future we would like to focus on opening up the knowledge base to other internal or external players using Liferay's secure functions. We are also considering going mobile with our 6.2 version, which is out already, and offering mobility solutions as they are now becoming indispensable for future projects\", concluded Ludovic Andrieux.","keywords":["CNP Assurances","Liferay","team","base","customers","Ludovic Andrieux","risk","member","team","Innovation and IS Impact Assessments","products","life","team","Solution","players","project","solution","Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts Group","solutions","pension insurance","insurance","policies","administrators","partnerships","Programmes","savings","needs","pensions","savings","users","range","Innovation team","protection","people","individuals","market changes","content","project management practices","France","policyholders","lifecycle","business efficiency requirements","CNP Assurances Innovation and IS Impact Assessments","project","projects","project","team","products","users","Europe","La Banque Postale","Caisse d'\u00c9pargne","number","customers","knowledge-base","Fran\u00e7oise Hoyek","Challenge","challenges","Programmes","all","project","users","interface","mobility solutions","order","customer feedback","number","product","products","projects","IS Department","Innovation team","Innovation team","product","challenge","demands","many","business units","content","background","version","knowledge base","web portal","customers","practices","content","management","users","insurance","access","information","Knowledge Base","flexibility","Business teams","challenge","participants","development","part","policyholders","All","one","business users","Programmes","needs","development phase","order","service","management procedures","flexibility","first-hand","credibility","environment","ratio","cost","reasons","start","Innovation team","tool","feedback chain","Business Value","appendices","files","data","total","repository","access rights","forum","compliance","community","information","user acceptance","grips","expertise","encryption","information system","standards","administration","environment","projects","projects","Business users","products","improvements","interfaces","services","availability","best practices","disparity","fact","way","time limits","concerns","development efforts","addition","benefits","range","components","all","source","functions","players","Design Thinking","users","products","product","products","collection","size","mobile","customer","contract","Resolution","information","access","contract components","user groups","function","management procedures","elements","implementation phase","efficiency","elements","application platform","charge","area","page","click","ease","user","problems"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=carrefour-bank","text":"The Carrefour Bank has been helping clients in Brazil since 1975.

It oversees the unity between design and implementation of public policy concerning cinema and other arts and industries of the moving image - namely audiovisual, video and multimedia, including video games.   The CNC pursues several missions, among which are observation of developments in professions and activities relating to cinema and other arts and industries of the moving image; contribution to the financing and development of such activities, and adapting them to market and technological changes. To that end, it grants financial aid to support the creation, production, distribution, exhibition and promotion of cinematographic and audiovisual works, as well as multimedia projects. It supports the creation and modernisation of cinemas; actions to promote image education and cultural broadcasting; initiatives for the development of the film industry which encourage the promotion and development of cinema and other arts and industries of the moving image both in France and abroad.   The CNC also audits the operating revenues from cinematographic or audiovisual works and documents created by cinema owners, and maintains film and audiovisual industry records. Lastly, it collects, preserves, restores and enhances cinematographic heritage and is also part of the fight against piracy of all works.   This industry represents approximately 1% of French GDP and employs some 340,000 people, matching the figures for the automotive industry.   Challenge     In 2008, the CNC had an intranet and a website, both of which were ageing, limited and failed to meet the Centre's needs. The CNC thus set its sights on completing two projects \u2013 the first involved a virtual office for its agents to consult all types of information and access their business applications via a personalised workspace; the second was a content management project both for the intranet and for the cnc.fr website. The latter presented several challenges for the Centre. Firstly in functional terms, with the need to develop new features to make the different types of support (more than sixty offered) visible to agents and visitors alike, and to enable better management of the document base. Graphical and usability challenges soon followed. The search engine was no longer suitable and the CNC needed an efficient search tool to match the wealth and wide variety of its document base. This comprises, amongst other things, studies, statistics and committee reports, representing in total over 3,000 documents to be organised by category based on content, support mechanisms and applicant profiles. As a result, the site ergonomics and interface became essential in order to provide a smooth navigation experience for internet users and simplify access to applications for support. Brand image and communication were the final hurdle. The CNC website needed to serve as a real showcase for the organisation and present its history, founding principles, missions and structure,as well as shine a spotlight on French cinematographic heritage.     A call for tenders was thus launched among several companies and, as a result, Liferay was selected. At the same time, the CNC chose Workey as a paperless form solution and Alfresco for its document management.     Choosing and implementing the solution     The decision to use Liferay to revamp the website was based on several criteria. In addition to the company's reputation thanks to the Open Source aspect of its offering, Liferay natively integrates a large number of features (portlets) which are highly appreciated at the CNC. The solution is flexible, agile and makes it possible to meet users' content management needs. Furthermore, it allows simple integration of agent's business applications.     Added value for the organisation     The CNC is extremely satisfied with the ease of content management offered by Liferay.     Numerous features are available via a simple, user-friendly interface. While organising and presenting all the content remain an ongoing challenge for the CNC, categorisation by applicant (artists, authors, producers, etc.), production type and project phase when searching for support and financing is considered satisfactory. It is easier and faster for visitors to access the automatic (based on the economic success of a project) or selective (based on artistic criteria following judgement by professional committees) support application forms. Liferay's interfacing with the CNC's third-party solutions facilitates the digitisation of these applications, allowing faster processing and decision-making.     The search engine also represents significant added value for the CNC given the quantity, diversity and wealth of its content. The CNC's document base contains several thousand categorised articles, with more than 30 items spanning multiple professions created for each category. As the content is regularly updated, this Search function is subject to continuous optimisation to ensure visitors can access the relevant information as quickly as possible. Following the overhaul of its website, the CNC has enjoyed increasing success. The site averages 100,000 visitors a month and more than one million a year.     The CNC foresees a number of future developments.     First of all, mobility. Users must be able to access certain content (schedules, news, sectoral studies, etc.) from a tablet or smartphone natively via a user-friendly interface. The CNC therefore plans to upgrade to Liferay 6.2, which offers this \"responsive design\" feature. The CNC is also looking to give greater visibility to works and offer content in a range of formats to reach audiences with varying needs and communication methods directly, from young creators to experienced producers. This requires much more in-depth indexing, categorisation and presentation of content based on visitor profiles. The CNC also plans to develop specific channels perfectly suited to the needs of its audiences. This approach entails extensive knowledge of its users.     Lastly, for the \"World Cinema\" section aimed at film-makers worldwide to encourage the coproduction of works, the CNC aspires to restructure the content with a view to improving the usability and sharing of documents through Liferay Sync. This feature from Liferay enables offline document access, sharing, previews and synchronisation on mobile devices.","keywords":["Moving Image","Centre national du cin\u00e9ma et de l'image anim\u00e9e","image","development","missions","organisation","works","authority","Law","contribution","French National Centre for Cinematography","cinema","industries","industries","cinema","developments","aid","professions","production","film industry","solution","observation","arts","activities","arts","activities","creation","Minister for Culture","multimedia","video","design","changes","financing","industry","first","content management project","implementation","policy","unity","market","end","website","agents","Liferay","company","video games","features","documents","industries","cinema","cinemas","automotive industry","Brand image","Challenge","part","multimedia projects","development","arts","actions","creation","film","content","promotion","heritage","preserves","applicant","applications","projects","business applications","workspace","internet users","interface","exhibition","distribution","image education","broadcasting","initiatives","modernisation","operating revenues","cinema owners","industry records","visitors","piracy","fight","GDP","people","figures","business applications","support","needs","website","cnc.fr website","need","features","support","users","documents","integration","profiles","category","communication","challenges","document management","website","content management needs","content management","promotion","search engine","features","call","Users","document base","content","organisation","content","1%","types","agents","document base","solution","management","form","wealth","agent","studies","organisation","result","access","heritage","missions","companies","intranet","information","intranet","usability","French","site","feature","result","criteria","decision","number","value","visitors","visitors","interface","variety","support mechanisms","things","total","committee reports","statistics","site ergonomics","order","spotlight","structure","principles","history","showcase","tenders","both","sights","office","latter","terms","types","website","developments","feature","professions","category","all","addition","reputation","aspect","offering","portlets","ease","Centre","France","challenges","content","search tool","content","Workey","Search function","articles","information","success","number","studies","design","documents","navigation experience","works","works","users","items","optimisation","overhaul","mobility","smartphone","schedules","tablet","news","needs","needs","search engine","content","Liferay 6.2","producers","visitor profiles","categorisation","knowledge","formats","creators","categorisation","document base","content","content","visibility","audiences","presentation","channels","audiences","sharing","usability","synchronisation","sharing","Alfresco","Open Source","communication methods","range","approach","section","view","film-makers","devices","previews","document access","applicant","applications","interface","visitors","World Cinema","support","project","producers","challenge","committees","solutions","production type","support application forms","coproduction","authors","artists","financing","success","criteria","interfacing","wealth","Liferay Sync","project phase","judgement","decision-making","processing","digitisation","quantity","diversity","value","indexing"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=cross-country-home-services","text":"Cross Country Home Services, Inc. (CCHS) is dedicated to making home management easy by offering a full selection of hassle-free, cost-effective home solutions, including warranty products and maintenance plans. Since 1978, the company has built a reputation for excellence and today is one of the leading national providers of these products and services. Technology has played a pivotal role in the rapid growth of CCHS and its commitment to providing unmatched customer service resulting in a doubling of the company's revenues over the past five years.   Consumers can buy home warranties and home maintenance plans directly from CCHS or through select affinity partners in mortgage, banking, insurance, real estate and utilities industries. Products include some of the industry's best known brands, including TotalProtect Home Warranty, Home Protect Warranty, Residential MD Home Warranty and HMS Home Warranty. The company's customer care staff is available 24 hours, 365 days a year and is dedicated to ensuring the highest level of service. Homeowner needs are quickly resolved through a national network of over 40,000 service providers who deliver reliable, timely service to CCHS's customer base across all 50 states.   Challenge     In late 2011, CCHS made a decision to launch a new direct-to-consumer strategy and expand its web presence to accommodate this new direction. CCHS had over fifteen websites geared towards consumers, institutional clients, and partners offering content, e-commerce, customer self-service and many other applications. These websites ran on a variety of technology platforms reducing business agility, increasing total cost of ownership, and making content sharing, application development, operations and maintenance more complex. CCHS wanted to take this opportunity to re-engineer and re-platform their existing consumer websites to better prepare CCHS for the new direct-to-consumer market.     The key challenge was to create a scalable consumer portal platform on a tight timeline that allowed multi-site capabilities, easy-to-use content management, application development and integration and end-user account management.     \"We had a very strong business case that helped us justify a major technology investment in our web architecture software,\" said Joel Steigelfest, CIO for CCHS. \"We needed something that would continue to grow and expand as our company did the same. We think Liferay and Xtivia are the winning combination for CCHS.\"     Resolution     CCHS selected Liferay to provide core enterprise portal features, robust web content and document management, enterprise search, social and collaboration features, and site staging and publishing capabilities for their public and consumer-oriented websites. After choosing the product, CCHS selected Xtivia, a Platinum Liferay Services Partner to help them accomplish their goals. Xtivia worked jointly with the CCHS business and IT teams in an agile, Scrum-based approach to deliver a maintainable solution within the desired timeline.     Initially, the project team focused on laying the portal and content management foundation using Liferay, and migrating the CCHS public site ( www.cchs.com ) to the Liferay platform. The technical team took the new look-and-feel from the creative designers and created Liferay themes, set up multiple page templates, and developed web content structures and templates to ease content maintenance by non-technical content owners. Additionally, the team set up multi-stage content approval workflows and staging with remote publishing, as well as used RESTful web services for application integration. From an infrastructure perspective, the enterprise systems engineering team set up a high-availability production environment with both horizontal and vertical clustering.     The joint CCHS\/Xtivia project team delivered on an extremely challenging timeline, launching a production Liferay platform with a redesigned and revamped public site ( www.cchs.com ) in under three months. Xtivia also trained the CCHS content team to use the Liferay Portal and content management system to maintain the site and to prepare for future content migration onto the Liferay platform.     In parallel to launching the public cchs.com site, the project team initiated development of the direct-to-consumer site ( www.totalprotect.com ) setting up additional Liferay themes, page templates, web content structures, approval workflows, and remote publishing. This new site includes several applications geared towards helping consumers sign up for CCHS home warranty and maintenance plans, renew\/upgrade existing plans and place claims. These applications involve RESTful integration with internal CCHS systems including Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) and Oracle CRM.     The new consumer site ( www.totalprotect.com ) launched in under a month after the CCHS public site went live.     Xtivia and CCHS continue to work together on migrating other CCHS sites onto the Liferay platform and bringing new capabilities to users through deeper integrations with internal CCHS systems including Oracle EBS, Oracle CRM, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition and ImageNow.     Business Value Added     The Liferay platform has prepared CCHS to move into new markets and products, increasing its business agility and reducing IT-related costs.     Sean Mooney, VP of Marketing for CCHS said: \"This new web platform will greatly improve our speed to market with new products and supporting websites and in today's business environment, speed and agility can mean the difference between success and failure.\"","keywords":["CCHS","platform","www.cchs.com","Liferay","growth","Cross Country Home Services, Inc.","service providers","Consumers","home warranties","reputation","services","products","timeline","home management","home maintenance","Xtivia","company","one","customer service","maintenance plans","affinity partners","Technology","home solutions","providers","applications","business case","company","team","warranty products","excellence","doubling","revenues","commitment","selection","something","Products","websites","service","service","Resolution CCHS","company","role","web content","content","customer care staff","product","site","consumers","strategy","consumer","industries","industry","Challenge","customer self-service","technology platforms","platform","Home Warranty","content management","end-user account management","document management","insurance","real estate","banking","mortgage","utilities","applications","brands","some","teams","project team","level","Homeowner needs","network","customer base","states","decision","business","integration","websites","websites","maintenance","consumer websites","site","site","Home Protect Warranty","Residential MD Home Warranty","HMS Home Warranty","company","market","content maintenance","challenge","combination","application development","capabilities","publishing","partners","cost","business agility","application development","capabilities","Services Partner","approach","timeline","portal","templates","page templates","features","opportunity","ownership","project team","consumers","home warranty","IT","solution","web content structures","themes","applications","look-and-feel","technology investment","web architecture software","Sean Mooney","same","enterprise search","staging","collaboration","web presence","direction","e-commerce","clients","variety","content sharing","operations","maintenance","integration","cchs.com","systems","goals","content management foundation","designers","TotalProtect","enterprise portal features","publishing","page templates","development","plans","plans","project team","sites","Xtivia","web platform","approval workflows","web content structures","themes","consumer site","products","products","RESTful","parallel","place","claims","integrations","websites","systems","markets","Marketing","market","Business Value","costs","business agility","agility","CIO for CCHS","platform","Joel Steigelfest","users","speed","business environment","Scrum","site","site","capabilities","web services","production","content team","success","failure","difference","enterprise systems engineering team","speed","Oracle","application integration","Oracle CRM","content management system","publishing","content approval","timeline","content owners","workflows","production environment","clustering","infrastructure perspective","content migration","ImageNow","Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition","EBS","Oracle E-Business Suite"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=grdf","text":"GRDF brings together all of the natural gas distribution facilities for 11 million customers in France.

Sponsored by NASA and NSF and in coordination with the Department of State and NOAA, GLOBE is implemented in 116 countries, including the US. GLOBE promotes the teaching and learning of science, enhances environmental literacy and stewardship, and promotes scientific discovery. GLOBE also supports students, teachers and scientists worldwide to collaborate with each other on inquiry-based investigations of the Earth system.   Upgrading Fifteen Years of Legacy Systems and Data     The GLOBE data and information system (DIS, including web interface) originally utilized a variety of technologies established over 15 years of operations, which became difficult to maintain and enhance. GLOBE and its partners wanted to develop a new, modern and collaborative environment, while maintaining the content, features and legacy data associated with the original system. The new framework was required to support over 30,000 organizations and over 100,000 monthly visitors with a role structure that provided appropriate permissions and controls for a large community of international users.     A Modern Approach to Content Management and Collaboration     NASA wanted a new approach to redesign and rebuild GLOBE\u2019s DIS. The team at Science Systems and Applications, Inc. (SSAI) was selected to manage the project.     They chose Liferay Portal as the primary solution to replace the legacy system and provide new features to help revitalize the program. Liferay provided integrated user management, content management and collaboration within an enterprise-quality architecture. Liferay supported scalability and the ability to operate in dedicated, virtualized or cloud based hosting environments. The ability to integrate J2EE web-based technologies easily into a portlet allowed for customized solutions and applications where needed.     Liferay also offered the ability to integrate with backend legacy systems while creating a new and consistent look and feel across GLOBE.gov. GLOBE\u2019s Liferay solution has proven the ability to handle serving nearly 30,000 individual organizations and associated pages, as well as supporting a complex organization and permissions hierarchy. On top of the large number of organizational pages, GLOBE serves 100,000 individual customizable user pages with the scalability to handle more as the program grows. Liferay\u2019s language support has also provided capabilities which support GLOBE\u2019s multilingual international audience.     Through Liferay\u2019s modular Software Development Kit, the development of plugins was easy to build and maintain. The SDK Plugins enable SSAI to distribute plugin development and plugins\u2019 individual enhancements. The ability to develop hooks into Liferay\u2019s core systems supported customization of GLOBE.gov\u2019s website features as well as development of migration tools for transferring 15 years\u2019 worth of user and organizational information.     2013 Website of the Year     Since initial rollout, the GLOBE website has added over 5,000 additional user accounts and has seen the average monthly traffic increase by 20%. Scaling has not been an issue. A year after deployment, GLOBE moved to a cloud hosting environment, resulting in significant cost savings \u2013 something which was not possible with the previous legacy architectures. This made GLOBE one of the first Liferay clustered environments in the cloud. Liferay awarded GLOBE the 2013 Pulse Award for Website of the Year, an award that honors Liferay customers that deliver exceptional web experiences to their users.     In 2015, GLOBE upgraded their website to Liferay Portal 6.2. Liferay\u2019s workflow capabilities have allowed GLOBE to manage a complex hierarchical publishing model that works with their regional sites. They also launched a new brand look and feel, including real-time animation features in the site\u2019s visual data displays. Finally, the site is now responsive and more mobile-friendly, and there are multiple apps available for GLOBE protocols that use Liferay\u2019s single sign-on feature.     GLOBE\u2019s future development plans include creating a low-bandwidth site for countries that still utilize dial-up.

The company is headquartered in Budapest, Hungary, and employs more than 2,000 back-office and sales staff. In 2009 and 2010, Fundamenta was awarded the \"Employer of the Year\" in the financial sector.   Challenge     In late 2008, through a series of proposed \"e-Front End\" projects, Fundamenta determined that its home page was no longer state-of-the-art. The isolated front-end systems had no common design or consistency in communication. Common functions like sign-on or user security had been developed independently with increased overall development costs.     Fundamenta's sales organization wanted a fresh, dynamic and brand new design, along with visual effects and interactive, rich-client \"Web 2.0-like\" functions. Fundamenta's IT was looking for an appropriate platform and technology for mission-critical \"e-process\" developments for the future.     Resolution     Fundamenta eventually decided that a portal solution was necessary to fulfill the business and technological expectations. At the beginning of 2009, an evaluation process was initiated to find the most appropriate product. Eleven products were compared on the basis of \"The Enterprise Portals Report 2009\" evaluation document. The four deciding factors were: functionality, technology, vendor, and costs. The three best products were installed and a demo application was developed in each environment. Liferay Portal proved to be the most effective, and Fundamenta decided to start the project on Liferay.     Fundamenta created a completely redesigned customer portal. The new portal enabled Fundamenta's customers to evaluate their needs, select the appropriate products, calculate the product benefits, and fill and submit the contract form online. This new sales channel brought an exponential increase in Fundamenta's revenue.     The new sales network extranet delivers up-to-date information about products, events, and competitions. A new communication platform (e-mail, forum, success stories, etc.) also supports the optimal information exchange between Fundamenta's sales people.     After introducing the new portal solution in 2010, online sales revenue increased by 37 percent compared to 2009. Database and application server maintenance costs were also reduced by $15,000 per year since Liferay Portal is installed on open source platforms (e.g., Linux, JBoss, MySQL). Liferay Portal was the common development platform for such innovative and necessary solutions and will also be regarded in the future as a front-end integration platform of new solutions.     Fundamenta implements Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition (EE) and receives regular service packs, security, and bug fixes.

The company, which is also Germany's third-largest travel insurer, offers a full range of life, casualty, property, accident and motor insurance. With gross premiums written of 671 Million EUROs in 2005, HanseMerkur's investment portfolio registered at around 3 billion EUROs in 2005.   Challenge     HanseMerkur set a goal to dramatically improve its web presence and to increase the amount of information available online to prospective customers. The company envisioned a site populated with marketing content in mixed formats like HTML, various graphics, and pdf. Visitors to the site would interact with online content including contracts, job applications and downloadable forms. Hence, a content management system (CMS) capable of managing its 350+ pages of content was high on the list of desired capabilities and features.     Resolution     After evaluating a number of solutions, HanseMerkur decided an open source portal would work best as a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework. HanseMerkur then quickly chose Liferay Portal as the best candidate to provide a foundation for this enterprise-wide SOA. Liferay's ease of use, scalable CMS and high degree of functionality compared to that of the other portal offerings further solidified the company's decision.     Moreover, HanseMerkur was impressed with the Liferay consulting team's vision and depth of knowledge. HanseMerkur traveled to the Cebit conference specifically to meet with Liferay representatives, after which a proof of concept was delivered. As Liferay provided further ideas and vision for the portal's potential, the initial effort grew into a full collaborative development and integration engagement that leveraged personnel from both HanseMerkur and Liferay's German and U.S. teams.     Despite a detailed yet oft-changing list of specifications, the HanseMerkur site was successfully delivered under tight deadlines. The end result was a portal that exceeded the client's original vision and showcases the fruits of its collaboration with liferay. Besides the strong, scalable content management capabilities demanded, the portal also delivers added site functionality and enhanced marketing potential through a search engine optimization (SEO) feature that HanseMerkur sponsored and which was immediately added to Liferay's 4.2 release.     Liferay Portal continues to provide a framework for further enterprise integration throughout the HanseMerkur organization. Following the first successful team effort and the establishment of a strong working relationship, Liferay worked with HanseMerkur on new development and enhancements, including the streamlining of HanseMerkur's back-end processes to bolster the company's competitive edge in the insurance marketplace.     Notable benefits of using Liferay Portal have included:           Scalability \u2013 Liferay Portal's CMS easily manages HanseMerkur's 350+ pages of mixed content.

Specializing in insurance for those on complimentary pensions, KLESIA essentially brings together pension funds, social security institutions, and health insurance funds. It currently has 3,200 employees.   In 2012, the Group recorded revenue of approximately \u20ac8 billion in complimentary pensions and personal insurance. 60% of this figure came from agreements with professional sector representatives who choose or recommended KLESIA to manage the social security and\/or health insurance contracts of the workers in their sectors.   As a leader in complimentary health insurance for professional sector employees, including those working in pharmaceuticals, freight and passenger road transport, HORECA, real estate, watchmaking, and floristry, the Group can count close to 370,000 businesses of every size and industry among its customers for social security and health insurance. Klesia covers 3.5 million people.   Challenge     In difficult economic times where legislation is rapidly changing and customers are becoming more demanding, KLESIA has had to face multiple strategic challenges. These include establishing a new identity as a social innovator in its market, streamlining its teams and processes, gaining customers' trust, and successfully moving into new territories. To respond to these challenges, KLESIA had to get its website live very quickly so as to display a coherent image of the new Group and reinforce its history, values, objectives, and ambitions.     Eventually, in addition to functioning as a collection of general content, the site would have to become a real tool for steering and managing customer relations. It was necessary for KLESIA to suggest innovative offers and services in dedicated, personalized sections of the site, for example, in order to gain the trust of the different professional sectors. The second version of the site, which is currently under construction, would have to achieve the above by being available in as many editorial and graphic versions as KLESIA has customers in different business sectors.     The Communication and IT Departments are the two main teams working on the project, which is overseen by the Cross-Company Projects Department.     Resolution     KLESIA chose Liferay's solution to develop its digital strategy. They did so for a number of reasons.     The first reason was due to its flexibility of content management. KLESIA had to quickly create a corporate website using the new brand colors which would display coherent content reflecting the merging of D&O and Mornay and the new Group's services, including the KLESIA Made-to-Measure Health Insurance range.     Secondly, Liferay was chosen for its Java environment and ease of integration with different information systems.     \"Given that the two companies have merged, the solution we chose had to be capable of integrating with the different data systems used by each\", explained Pascal Brout\u00e8le, Head of Collaboration, Cross-Company Applications and IT Integration Division. The Open Source nature of the solution was also a big draw.     Other key factors included its agility (easy management of portlets and compliance with Java standards), its scalability (multiple possibilities for growth), and its robustness.     KLESIA also wanted a solution which could integrate an authentication system so that they could offer their customers specific services based on their business profiles. The different professional sectors could therefore access relevant services and information and advice; access to regulatory services, in particular, was a priority. Employees would need to be able to access an up-to-date record of points (RAP) and a record of their personal details online, while pensioners would need access to their last payments and tax returns.     Finally, KLESIA wanted a website that was mobile- and tablet-friendly. By the end of 2013, there were 27 million mobile web surfers in France. That's an increase of 3.4 million in one year, and it represents 50% of the population aged over 11. Tablets and smartphones are clearly undeniable avenues for the future.     Business Value Added     Within a few weeks, the first version of the website using the new brand colors went live for customers and partners to see KLESIA and what it had to offer. Customers can already access information using their own profile: individuals, companies, partners or professional sectors. The site has been well-received. Customers have found it easy to navigate and user-friendly.     The second version, which is currently under-construction, will allow the Group to continue down its path of separating content by professional sector and offering tailored services using an authorization management system. Pensioners, for example, can see their pension payments, register change of details or download tax return forms.     Finally, KLESIA will offer its customers the opportunity to pay online, in particular for health costs, health insurance, and personal insurance.","keywords":["KLESIA","social security Group","insurance","pensions","customers","workers","sector representatives","merging","challenges","brand colors","D&O Groups","customers","insurance","sectors","innovator","health insurance contracts","sectors","social security","businesses","employees","IT Departments","solution","health insurance funds","Liferay","site","social security institutions","figure","agreements","leader","pension funds","version","nature","times","revenue","reason","Mornay","Customers","Group","project","customers","health insurance","health insurance","sector","increase","Group","Group","social security","employees","Challenge","offers","customers","teams","trust","business sectors","sections","Employees","Resolution KLESIA","Group","legislation","pharmaceuticals","industry","size","real estate","freight","road transport","passenger","floristry","watchmaking","services","processes","market","priority","content","content","website","identity","services","versions","solution","website","customers","site","site","version","content management","information systems","data systems","Customers","construction","management","compliance","reasons","merging","values","collection","example","trust","factors","tool","Business Value","integration","Pensioners","site","editorial","above","Communication","strategy","number","flexibility","territories","history","objectives","ambitions","image","addition","steering","customer relations","order","website","version","website","ease","environment","people","each","agility","portlets","Health Insurance","companies","HORECA","avenues","information","sectors","sector","health insurance","profile","partners","Tablets","services","population","smartphones","individuals","content","Cross-Company Projects Department","customers","50%","authorization management system","D&O","range","companies","pension payments","partners","construction","example","details","Java","Cross-Company Applications","Head of Collaboration","IT Integration Division","Open Source","path","change","health costs","opportunity","services","services","pensioners","services","Pascal Brout\u00e8le","France","solution","authentication system","information","business profiles","payments","details","record","tax returns","record","tax return forms","web surfers","robustness","standards","scalability","possibilities","growth","advice","RAP","points","access"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=huhtamaki","text":"Huhtamaki, Inc. (Huthamaki North America) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Huhtamaki Oyj. Huhtamaki Oyj is a global manufacturer of consumer and specialty packaging products based in Espoo, Finland. With a focus and expertise in molded fiber packaging, flexible packaging, release films and paper cup manufacturing, the Huhtamaki offering includes standardized products and customized packaging alongside complete packaging systems. Consumers may be familiar with their retail brands such as Chinet\u00ae and BioWare\u00ae.   Huhtamaki's net sales topped EUR 2.3 billion in 2013. Their global presence includes approximately 14,100 employees distributed in 31 countries in 59 manufacturing units worldwide. The parent company, Huhtam\u00e4ki Oyj, is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd under the symbol HUKI.   Challenge     One of Huhtamaki North America's strategic initiatives to increase customer satisfaction and drive revenues was to use the web to expose their product catalogs to a larger audience. They had already established several internal successes using the Liferay Portal platform within their daily operations.     A key decision was made to revamp the public website presence and to integrate it with existing enterprise systems, which housed the various product catalogs.     Because the product catalogs crossed internal boundaries for lines of business, different teams needed the ability to easily and consistently maintain the system.     Resolution     Huhtamaki North America selected Liferay Portal to develop their new customer website. Huhtamaki chose Xtivia for the company's track record of successful Liferay Portal implementations to help them accomplish their vision. With a timeline and budget in mind, Xtivia collaborated extensively with the business and IT teams to establish an Agile approach that would meet their needs and result in a maintainable solution. Xtivia worked cohesively with a third-party design firm to translate a modern user experience into a Liferay User Interface.     Core default Liferay Portal features that were leveraged on this project include:           Web Content Management      Documents and Media Management      Enterprise Search      Liferay Themes leveraging Velocity, CSS, HTML5, and AUI      Site Staging and Publishing          More than 40 public facing pages were brought to life on the Liferay-built site at  www.us.huhtamaki.com  with a design that exemplifies the Huhtamaki brand and philosophy. Multiple content structures and display templates were designed to deliver consistency and repeatability using Liferay Web Content Management (WCM). This  Sustainability page , which describes Huhtamaki's efforts towards reducing its environmental impact, demonstrates an effective and innovative use of the parallax scrolling technique.     Multiple product catalogs were designed to be highly responsive to minimize page load times. The single-page interfaces use popular JavaScript frameworks such as AlloyUI and Backbone.js to avoid page reloads and maximize system resources as users navigate through a large volume of products.     Modern best practices for application architecture were a key consideration when handling integration with existing systems to retrieve product data. A services tier encapsulates a manageable REST API to decouple the systems and enable them to scale while minimizing downtime.     \"Liferay Portal is a proven enterprise portal platform with a large customer base and a high level of customer satisfaction. Liferay Portal includes an intuitive interface and the latest website technologies. These features helped us achieve rapid website development,\" said Chris Cooper, PMP, Project Manager at Huhtamaki.     \"We are impressed that Liferay continually recognizes Xtivia as the Liferay North America Partner of the Year. We selected Xtivia and found that they were great partners with us and our third-party web design team.     \"Xtivia's website development team has a friendly, professional approach to their work. They helped us achieve our website vision and provided expert guidance along the way. With Xtivia we were able to produce an outstanding, functional and reliable website to help us connect to our customers. In addition, we were able to do so within our project budget and timeline!\"     Business Value Added     Xtivia's team leveraged the Liferay development paradigm to deliver an extremely fast and easy-to-use online product catalog, which allows users to quickly find the exact products they desire. This implementation effectively leverages Liferay capabilities that drive consistency and maintainability throughout the website.","keywords":["Huhtamaki, Inc.","Liferay Portal","Consumers","website development team","Sustainability page","approach","products","products","Huthamaki North America","packaging systems","consumer","packaging","fiber packaging","packaging","packaging","subsidiary","net sales","paper cup manufacturing","offering","expertise","brands","specialty","focus","films","enterprise systems","successes","product catalog","HUKI","design","website presence","Xtivia","systems","Espoo","Finland","BioWare","Chinet","product catalogs","web","presence","life","product catalogs","Web Content Management Documents","platform","decision","customer satisfaction","Challenge","customer website","features","system","employees","countries","manufacturing units","revenues","initiatives","audience","operations","teams","pages","product catalogs","teams","product catalogs","User Interface","features","content structures","consistency","page","products","business","project","Web Content Management","business","timeline","website","load times","user experience","Resolution","vision","implementations","company","budget","efforts","brand","site","partners","parallax scrolling technique","use","IT","needs","solution","design firm","Publishing","Themes","boundaries","lines","track record","mind","web design team","Xtivia","interfaces","Project Manager","philosophy","repeatability","display templates","impact","frameworks","NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd","website development","ability","website technologies","approach","website vision","website","work","way","customers","team","consistency","Business Value","timeline","Agile","HTML5","CSS","Velocity","AUI Site Staging","Media Management Enterprise Search","Xtivia","users","project budget","development paradigm","implementation","North America Partner of the Year","www.us.huhtamaki.com","WCM","JavaScript","AlloyUI","guidance","products","addition","capabilities","maintainability","enterprise portal platform","consideration","PMP","users","interface","Chris Cooper","integration","system resources","customer satisfaction","volume","page reloads","js","product data","application architecture","services tier","REST API","scale","downtime","level","customer base","Backbone.","best practices"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=domino-s","text":"The Domino\u2019s world is made up of many different moving parts \u2013 from corporate team members and franchisees to their delivery experts collectively driving 10 million miles a day. Although this model is great for business, it doesn\u2019t prove to be an easy method for communication.   Many times, the corporate team members found gaps in communicating with franchisees and store team members. A coupon update seems simple enough, but communicating that to franchisees that may or may not be checking email, or relying on other communication methods, means the message could get missed.   With the help of Liferay, Domino\u2019s first developed a low-cost online operations manual, which then developed into a fully functional intranet that allowed users to have a one-stop-shop for all things Domino\u2019s. News updates, quick links and department-specific home pages were all features of live.dominos.com, their first go at the intranet game.   More Communication, More Relevant Experiences     \u201cOur goal was to take the current live.dominos.com and create a site that allowed more customization and created a more user-specific experience,\u201d said Stacie Barrett, manager of Internal Communications for Domino\u2019s Pizza.     Liferay\u2019s easy-to-use platform allowed Domino\u2019s in-house team to create a brand new intranet that was more than a great new look \u2013 it was a brand new way for Domino\u2019s corporate and franchise team members to get a user-specific experience with three separate home pages: Store, Franchisee and Corporate. Each site is designed for the group that it describes, allowing content to be more relevant to each user. Permissions are set to be site specific, allowing Domino\u2019s to share confidential information securely, which is important in the franchise model.     The platform also allowed Domino\u2019s in-house team to create new and exciting features to the site \u2013 most recently, a social sharing tool and an option for subscriptions. DPZ social came to life this past summer and now allows all Domino\u2019s corporate and franchise team members to share photos and posts just like they would on Facebook. This is a fun and interactive way for store team members, franchisees and corporate team members to interact with each other.     A new subscription-based news tool has also launched, which allows users to pick and choose what content they would like to be notified about. Domino\u2019s in-house team worked within the Liferay platform to create categories and permissions to make this type of service possible.     These features, along with things like a customizable dashboard, user profile, messaging system and many others have made dLive a great place for user-specific information. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Increase in Traffic: 8,000 to 20,000 Per Week     With weekly support calls between Liferay and Domino\u2019s in-house team, along with previous work with Xtivia, traffic has increased from 8,000 per week with the previous site, to 20,000 per week with the new dLive.

It serves people and communities in 21 states from coast to coast with 86 hospitals, 128 continuing care facilities and home health and hospice programs that provide nearly 2.8 million visits annually.   The organization\u2019s executive team needed many different tools for business intelligence (BI) reporting, including BusinessObjects (BO) 4, BO 3, Tableau, QlikView and custom applications. This required them to log into each of these separate systems to reach the information they needed. The system was inefficient, time-consuming, and it negatively impacted the executive team\u2019s ability to make quick business decisions on a day-to-day basis. The team decided it needed to revamp the process by uniting all their business intelligence systems into one comprehensive site.   Designing a Fully Integrated Internal Analytics Portal     The team selected Dunn Solutions to help them develop an analytics portal that would consolidate all BI systems, access and reports into one unified view. The Liferay platform was chosen as the foundation for the new portal, due to its strengths in integration and its open source technology. The solution incorporated custom-developed connectors using each BI system\u2019s APIs and it allowed the hospital\u2019s BI team to add any new BI systems with these connectors, should they need more in the future.     The new analytics portal enables single-sign-on access for the entire executive team so that they can access all BI reports in one place. Additional functionality that was developed in the portal includes:           Ability to flag reports as favorites.      Administrator ability to generate audit reports across all systems.      Administrator ability to adjust permissions based on user role.      Generate consistent report view regardless of BI system.      Browse and search across many BI systems at once.      Execute on-demand data refresh.

The group is active in 18 regions, with more than 1,200 branches, 12,000 employees and 2 million clients. Today, the parent company, boasts an impressive 9 territorial offices and roughly 700 operation branches throughout 15 different regions. Since 2015 BPER Banca, whose business model is based on its territorial culture, has developed a new identity centered on the values of responsibility, loyalty and pragmatism. It hoped to carry this customer-centric spirit of innovation into a new market by developing a new customer portal.   BPER\u2019s goal was to build a customer portal for an unexplored market where growth drivers were not based on existing market prices and competition, sometimes known as a \u201cblue ocean.\u201d The goal of the project was to learn more about building a customer-centric banking portal from scratch, based on the needs of a specific community. The group identified the migrant market in Italy as a potential project and developed a plan that left room for the creativity and innovation they hoped to implement.   The group identified nine key design elements that it wanted to incorporate into a clear framework. The initiative proved to be a thriving work-in-progress right from the outset. The methods adopted, the actions implemented and the ideas developed allowed the entire work team, which also involved the partnership of BPER Service, a BPER Banca company in the IT sector, to work with a level of collaboration that was essential for successfully completing the project.   A Personalized Customer Portal in Only Three Months     After their plan was finalized, the team searched for a platform that met two key needs: cloud implementation and robust integration capabilities. After a review, the group chose Liferay because it was a full platform that allowed the ability to customize elements. This made Liferay a winning choice for both their short- and long-term strategy.     The BeAtlas project, launched in the summer of 2015, was completed in only three months, thanks to collaboration between BPER and Noovle, a cloud solutions implementer.     BPER Banca needed to rapidly integrate solutions to meet the demands expressed by the various communities throughout the territory. Noovle developed Idea Management and Idea Generation modules exclusively for the BeAtlas portal, which allowed for the standardization and development of an efficient process for creating solutions to meet each need.     The development of the BeAtlas portal was a collaboration among 30 team members from different territories and roles. The contribution by colleagues of non-Italian origin, who had first-hand knowledge of the integration process in Italy, proved to be of primary importance.     Using a Start-Up Mindset to Create Innovative Services     To implement the Liferay solution, the group first adopted a prototype based on a lean business model inspired by start-up strategies. The main goal during this initial phase was to validate the business model and make improvements after testing it in real-life scenarios.     The service model was structured with three channels:           A Social Business Manager, normally a BPER Banca colleague, whose objective was to initiate relations with communities of foreigners, creating and developing projects.      A Relationship Center, a dedicated, multilingual phone line designed to provide basic information about products.      A dedicated banking portal for communities of foreigners in Italy, able to facilitate relationships among all members of the community, share information and listen to the specific needs of each community. The BeAtlas portal was a perfect integration of several elements: the Liferay platform was connected to Google Hangouts and the Google Translate API, creating a Multilanguage collaboration site that offered better customer experience. The whole process starts with a forum, where users make suggestions. Common ideas are gathered in a thread (Theme) that can be structured into a Proposal, and if approved, becomes a Project. A Community Activity dashboard allows the Social Business Manager to administer the activities relevant to each community and project. A back-end tool provides a daily, detailed report in four languages (Italian, English, French and Spanish).          Another critical factor during the prototyping phase was finding a way to incorporate feedback from first adopters. The registration method in the final portal was greatly simplified thanks to input from primary users, optimizing the user experience for everyone.     Because of the integration of digital technology, innovative solutions and relational skills, the BeAtlas project enjoyed important recognition at a national level: in 2015 it was awarded the ABI Prize for sustainable innovation, and in 2016, the Prize for Innovation by the Italian Presidenza del Consiglio in the same category.     A Lower Cost for More Personalized Customer Experiences     For the first release, six communities were involved, all of which worked with BPER Banca to develop the plan for the construction of the platform. As of today, 18 communities are included in the platform and more than 1,000 members have registered.     One of the new financing methods that BPER Banca decided to test was crowdfunding. This activity was made possible thanks to the Liferay platform, and future plans for the portal include developing the capability to take donations directly from the platform.     The cloud deployment plus the Platform as a Service model proved to be a winning solution in reducing BPER Group\u2019s time to market. It also lowered the costs to develop the projects and the time needed to implement personalized solutions.     Thanks to the development of this portal, the BPER focus has shifted from single users to communities of foreigners in Italy. They are building solutions based on real needs, both banking and otherwise, and the co-creation of solutions that meet the demands of a continuously evolving market.","keywords":["BPER Banca","integration","Banca","project","collaboration","work team","banks","Italy","platform","Liferay","group","customer portal","communities","market","market","business model","solutions","goal","plan","parent company","innovation","BeAtlas","group","regions","regions","Banco di Sardegna","Cassa di Risparmio di Bra","Cassa di Risparmio di Saluzzo","design elements","branches","operation branches","foreigners","customer portal","banking portal","colleagues","platform","employees","clients","offices","culture","identity","values","responsibility","loyalty","pragmatism","spirit","methods","level","information","BPER Service","Social Business Manager","community","project","project","group","group","migrant market","needs","goal","work-in-progress","Cost","competition","innovation","actions","ideas","team","project","communities","financing methods","solutions","solutions","solution","communities","banking portal","community","community","group","projects","growth drivers","ocean","market prices","collaboration","scratch","creativity","collaboration","framework","initiative","outset","Noovle","need","needs","colleague","solutions","collaboration site","Services","plan","business model","business model","service model","needs","goal","development","process","team members","integration process","elements","communities","communities","solutions","relations","foreigners","relationships","members","cloud solutions implementer","elements","demands","territory","territories","prototype","cloud implementation","integration capabilities","strategy","platform","platform","room","Customer Portal","strategies","phase","objective","Start-Up Mindset","thanks","standardization","modules","roles","contribution","origin","importance","knowledge","partnership","IT sector","ability","review","choice","solution","users","innovation","integration","plan","scenarios","channels","phone line","products","user experience","Customer Experiences","members","portal","portal","projects","solutions","level","construction","all","platform","platform","Platform","forum","thread","plans","Idea Management","activity","improvements","market","market","everyone","input","category","skills","technology","release","model","needs","platform","recognition","thanks","users","Thanks","banking","Italian","Community Activity dashboard","Idea Generation","non-Italian","Prize for Innovation","ABI Prize","donations","capability","costs","demands","Relationship Center","Project","community","portal","project","process","cloud deployment","focus","co-creation","way","Presidenza del Consiglio","registration method","users","ideas","activities","customer experience","Social Business Manager","prototyping phase","Proposal","Theme","tool","languages","feedback","adopters","factor","suggestions","report","Multilanguage","Google Hangouts","Google Translate API","French","Spanish","English"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=diagnostic-lab-case-study","text":"This customer is a leader in the development and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products that enable physicians to provide greater individualized patient care. One significant product the organization developed is a patented Gastrointestinal (GI) Diagnostic Testing Kit. Physicians can request the kit online from the organization\u2019s laboratory and have it sent directly to patients who then administer it in their own home. Previously, patients had to go through extensive testing which required them to go to multiple doctors\u2019 offices over the course of weeks or even months. Even worse, because these tests were done at different times, the test results or the blood\/stool samples would often get lost, adding more unnecessary stress to patients, who then had to repeat these tests.   The new GI Diagnostic Testing Kit solved many of these patient problems by being easy to administer at home and combining multiple tests into one kit. However, they discovered another obstacle to making this testing process a truly innovative experience: the system for requesting and delivering results.   The current process was entirely manual, which was contributing to the lost results and samples. There were many different parties involved in requesting, testing and delivering patient information, and the paper process meant that there were large gaps of time between testing and results delivery. All of this created a high potential for mistakes, and the organization decided that, to turn its product into a true competitive advantage, it needed a digital solution to replace the manual process.   Custom Portal Reduced Patient Stress and Delivered More Accurate Results     After researching consultants and software, the organization decided to partner with Dunn Solutions and use the Liferay platform to deliver a full-featured portal that would serve patients, physicians and laboratory technicians with this process of diagnostic testing.     The new patient portal needed to achieve the following:           Integrate with the laboratory\u2019s patient database in order to    retrieve and display data.      Simple registration for patients and doctors.      Tracking for the current status of the tests at each point of    the process and a way to display it.      Controls for laboratory technicians and doctors to release    results when they were ready.      Extensive patient information tagging.      Geolocation to identify drop-off locations for patients.          In addition, the organization wanted the portal environment (both the database and servers) to be fully hosted and managed with Microsoft Azure technology, in order to ease the burden that managing the environment would place on the laboratory staff. This freed the team to focus on doing what it does best: accurate, efficient diagnostic testing.     The organization had a solid vision for how it wanted to use all of these functionalities to create an experience that differentiated them as a business. Once it had the right features and integrations in place, the team started to craft the right system.     Both patients and doctors are able to quickly and easily register themselves on the portal. Patients use codes given to them by their doctors at the beginning of the testing process, and doctors use their unique National Provider Identification (NPI) number for authentication. Once registered, patients and doctors are able to see exactly where the test is at every stage, including the doctor\u2019s initial request to deliver the test to the patient, delivery to the patient, delivery to the laboratory, testing by the laboratory and the final results. Because the portal provides patients with the closest drop-off location for their test, the entire process is now significantly easier for them. They receive the test, administer it, drop it off and receive a notification from their doctor as soon as the correct results are available. Because doctors have control over when to release the results, they are also able to ensure that everything is correct and there has been no mix-up with the patient\u2019s data. If there does seem to be an error, the system is already integrated with patient data tagging to help doctors and laboratory staff understand whether any mistake has been made.     The new portal leverages many out-of-the-box features of Liferay to accomplish all this, including single-sign-on access, two factor authentication, and customizable workflows and tasks. Dunn Solutions\u2019 expert developers also integrated the portal with many third-party systems, including EMR, accounting systems, and third-party logistics companies such as FedEx.     A Revolutionary Patient Testing Experience     The new patient portal has changed the lives of individuals struggling with chronic GI issues. The easier process of in-home testing, as well as being able to combine multiple tests into one, has reduced patients\u2019 stress while producing more effective results. The laboratory\u2019s new patient portal streamlines the doctor\/patient eco-system. With its ease of registration, access and dynamic results displays, this new portal reduces the number of doctor visits needed previously. Doctors can now order tests, send tests to the lab and release results to the patients directly from the portal.     The organization has been able to expand this solution further with interactive graphs of test results, a native mobile application that allows information to be accessed offline and text messaging capabilities with the platform for faster communication. Overall, it has achieved a unique, customized solution that enhances the effectiveness of its product and delivers a customer experience that fully integrates with the rest of its business.","keywords":["customer","products","testing","patients","Testing Kit","portal","tests","patients","organization","test","doctors","process","development","commercialization","Physicians","patients","physicians","doctors","organization","novel pharmaceutical","doctors","portal","test results","Patients","laboratory","organization","patient care","tests","patients","GI","home","stool samples","organization","Gastrointestinal","course","offices","blood","stress","team","solution","experience","product","tests","testing","testing","patients","Portal","results","results","kit","way","testing process","test","mobile application","experience","testing","testing","tests","patients","patients","patients","paper process","system","testing","patient","patient","kit","many","patients","process","home","results","delivery","patient information","All","Results","patient portal","doctors","doctor","results","samples","mistakes","process","process","results","process","laboratory","customer experience","portal","testing","organization","testing process","laboratory","laboratory","patients","organization","patient problems","obstacle","potential","database","laboratory technicians","patient database","data","partner","Dunn Solutions","system","doctors","patient portal","technology","all","Patient Stress","laboratory technicians","physicians","portal","patient portal","solution","organization","GI Diagnostic Testing Kit","laboratory","delivery","delivery","Controls","locations","order","environment","environment","laboratory staff","team","vision","platform","order","display","registration","tests","tests","patients","Liferay","business","features","number","authentication","patient information tagging","Geolocation","burden","servers","addition","functionalities","advantage","software","consultants","following","Tracking","status","point","accounting systems","systems","integrations","place","codes","beginning","Doctors","stage","parties","test results","stress","one","portal","results","features","authentication","developers","workflows","tasks","logistics companies","lives","individuals","GI issues","test","solution","patient","gaps","request","process","information","Microsoft Azure","doctor","registration","results displays","access","number","doctor visits","platform","communication","business","Revolutionary Patient Testing Experience","National Provider Identification","NPI","results","portal","access","results","doctor\/patient eco-system","ease","lab","graphs","text messaging capabilities","rest","effectiveness","data","data","system","FedEx","mistake","error","everything","location","laboratory staff","control","notification","EMR","mix-up"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=allianz","text":"Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd (Allianz) is the fourth-largest general insurance company in Australia with over two million policyholders. Allianz is also one of Australia\u2019s leading workers compensation insurers, providing coverage for more than half of Australia\u2019s largest 100 companies and one in five Australian employees.   Through a series of consumer surveys, Allianz identified that its customer online offering was lagging in overall functionality. While the company boasted a history of market leadership and strong brand recognition, it faced a new challenge of competing with younger, fast-growing insurers that were attracting and winning business with their dynamic online websites.   Matching Online Presence with Sales and Marketing Strategies     \u201cAs a sales tool, our online offering was not as effective as it could have been,\u201d explained Kerry Fullagar, Head of IT Strategy, Architecture and Development. \u201cIt was very informational and did communicate the Allianz branding via text and images, but we needed to take it to the next level.\u201d     Allianz undertook a complete site makeover to more effectively incorporate online presence into sales and marketing strategies. Allianz wanted the new site to not only provide valuable and relevant information, but also allow visitors to interact with the company and make purchases as simple and hassle-free as possible. \u201cWe needed our offering to echo our company\u2019s dedication to providing a superior customer experience,\u201d said Fullagar.     During an extensive search for the right technology, a number of proprietary and open source products were evaluated. Allianz considered building an in-house proprietary solution from scratch, but ultimately found everything they needed in Liferay, in terms of feature-set, ease of customisation, the ability to meet time and budget constraints, and make Allianz\u2019s business requirements a reality.     \u201cLiferay allowed us to do everything that we needed to with ease,\u201d said Fullagar. Integration with Allianz\u2019s existing databases and data sources enabled visitors to search for and save quotes, create unique user accounts, and establish an online identity with Allianz that tracked all their insurance activities.     After engaging with Liferay\u2019s professional services team the company launched My Insurance Portfolio, an entirely new customer portal providing visitors a comprehensive and interactive view of their insurance-related identity.     Enhanced User Convenience     Through My Insurance Portfolio, both existing and prospective customers can log-in to a secure online environment with centralised access to personal profiles, policy information, and purchasing options.     \u201cMy Insurance Portfolio is dynamic and personal, and a testimony to how technology can tangibly impact a business. Thanks to Liferay, our online presence echoes the company\u2019s core values and emphasis on quality service, and is now an integrated part of sales and marketing strategies,\u201d said Fullagar.     Allianz customers see an aggregated list of their policies and quote information complete with functionality for policy renewal and bill payment. In addition, My Insurance Portfolio also sends similar renewal and billing alerts for any non-Allianz policies an account holder adds to their portfolio, delivering a customer service experience truly devoted to user convenience. To help users quickly find relevant information in their future interactions with Allianz, the portal pulls and displays a history of all quotes and applications received and submitted. Not only can account holders view their policy information, they can edit and update personal details for all policies from one place and correspond with Allianz\u2019s support team with any questions they may have.","keywords":["Allianz Australia Insurance Ltd","company","Marketing Strategies","policyholders","Kerry Fullagar","Liferay","offering","Australia","everything","workers compensation insurers","insurers","companies","one","customer","My Insurance Portfolio","offering","functionality","history","employees","half","series","consumer surveys","coverage","policies","visitors","users","holders","Presence","IT Strategy","Sales","business","solution","company","company","Integration","customisation","customers","brand recognition","challenge","websites","market leadership","sales tool","sales","presence","visitors","services","technology","ease","budget constraints","branding","site","company","information","policies","portfolio","offering","information","ease","quotes","data sources","databases","user accounts","team","dedication","search","products","number","terms","ability","feature-set","scratch","images","text","level","site makeover","identity","information","company","visitors","sales","reality","business requirements","insurance activities","purchases","part","Architecture and Development","customer experience","presence","quality service","functionality","policy renewal","renewal","billing","account holder","policies","list","values","emphasis","bill payment","addition","alerts","policy information","portal","customer service experience","user convenience","interactions","history","quotes","support team","applications","details","place","questions","Insurance Portfolio","customers","policy information","business","identity","User Convenience","technology","purchasing options","profiles","access","environment","testimony","Thanks","view"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=mercury-insurance-group","text":"Mercury Insurance has been providing comprehensive insurance solutions since 1962, ranging from personal and business auto insurance to homeowners insurance to mechanical breakdown protection. During Mercury\u2019s digital transformation, the company embarked on the creation of a comprehensive customer portal that would allow its customers to manage their total relationship with Mercury. Mercury\u2019s portal enables customers to access their policy information and pay their bills.   In today\u2019s competitive business environment, where consumers can easily comparison shop on any device, customer portals need to be mobile-optimized, user friendly, secure and sophisticated\u2014which meant that Mercury needed to find a portal platform that could keep up with all these standards.   After reviewing competitive portal offerings, Mercury decided on Liferay because it was Java-based and offered content management support, mobile readiness, flexible integration with Mercury ecosystems, and compatibility with key open source technologies like OpenID with Facebook and Google.   A Way to View a Customer as a Name, Not a Number     Mercury wanted its new portal to achieve the following benefits:           Enhance customer experience      Increase customer retention with improved customer satisfaction      Stay competitive in the current marketplace      Reduce the volume of calls into the call center and to Mercury agents      Reduce customer service costs by providing self-service functionalities      Reduce printing and mailing costs by offering paperless communication      Maintain compliance with standards, statutes, regulations and policies          One of the main challenges was uniting multiple systems of record that connected to back-end databases for car insurance, home insurance and other offerings. Mercury\u2019s team unified policy and customer information into one customer identification system, and with Liferay, connected each insurance ID number with a name and customer profile. This allowed agents to identify people by name, rather than asking for a policy number. The tremendous amount of work that went into this simple change was the first big step toward Mercury launching its customer-centric strategy for the portal.     Improving Customer\u2019s Digital Experience     With the new portal, customers are able to sign in once and access all their policies in one location. The portal is mobile-responsive, which allows people to access their information at any time and place. Customers can reach out to agents directly for help, or use self-service options like viewing important messages, making payments securely and customizing communications preferences for e-documents or printed documents.     After the new portal was launched, Mercury surveyed its customers and continues to receive very positive feedback on the solution. Customers are pleased that they can manage their policies independently, without calling a service center or agents. In addition, the portal initiative helped Mercury gain 45 points in a J.D. Power study, due to the features in the new customer portal.     Future plans for the portal include creating native mobile app functionality, more feature sets and more advanced communication options. The Liferay platform is ready to support all of Mercury\u2019s plans, giving the insurance company confidence that its portal will continue to match the expectations of its customers as it moves further into creating a technologically advanced portal.","keywords":["Mercury Insurance","customer portal","customers","Liferay","customers","portal","auto insurance","homeowners insurance","portal","amount","business","breakdown protection","customers","insurance solutions","customer portals","company","platform","policy information","policies","systems","agents","Way","relationship","creation","transformation","bills","business environment","portal","insurance company confidence","policy","Customer","comparison shop","self-service functionalities","portal","standards","portal","car insurance","home insurance","volume","policies","device","consumers","user friendly","compatibility","offerings","compliance","portal","communication","Name","customer experience","initiative","name","insurance ID number","customer information","policy number","name","standards","calls","call center","mailing costs","customer service costs","offerings","strategy","customer identification system","people","statutes","databases","regulations","record","printing","challenges","team","ecosystems","readiness","open source technologies","integration","customer retention","customer satisfaction","marketplace","benefits","content management support","agents","customer profile","change","work","people","customer portal","portal","portal","Java","solution","service center","feedback","documents","e-documents","communications preferences","addition","points","study","platform","Customer","plans","all","expectations","Google","OpenID","Facebook","features","communication options","functionality","plans","app","feature sets","J.D.

Coach has continued to expand its brand in the realm of modern luxury throughout its more than 1,000 stores worldwide. With its continued expansions and more employees than ever, Coach needed to build a consolidated corporate intranet. Previously, employees could not search for documents, as Coach\u2019s online employee systems were built from various URLs without a consolidated intranet and content was frequently duplicated due to updates, which lead to confusion and lost time.   Coach also needed an improved way to reach and inform employees whose main connection to store information was through their smartphones and tablets, which were previously unreached by the company\u2019s online capabilities.     Coach wanted to provide its employees with the ability to find the information they needed for both serving customers and answering human resources questions, which led to the company deciding on a portal software. Coach chose Liferay because of its ability to consolidate information, reach employees on all devices, create a personalized dashboard, incorporate numerous features on a single platform and prepare the company for future digital transformation efforts.     Using Liferay, Coach created Coachweb, a single sign-on employee intranet that has become a cornerstone for Coach\u2019s digital ecosystem and the future of how they use technology to support their employees.     Connecting Employees to Content     Due to an unconsolidated database of content, Coach employees found difficulty in locating the correct version of a document they needed, leading to lost time spent searching online and confusion regarding out-of-date policies. Through the creation of Coachweb via Liferay, Coach was able to eliminate redundant, duplicate and incorrect information with an improved search functionality and content management system that vastly reduced the amount of time spent finding and updating needed documents from minutes to seconds.     By providing employees around the world with a consolidated platform, team members can self-service their needs and find fast answers to their questions while meeting the needs of in-store customers. Coach\u2019s employees in both stores and offices now use Liferay to find employee news, messages from the CEO, business strategies, earnings reports and HR information.     Creating a Digital Workplace     In the age of smartphone usage, increasingly fewer store employees are connecting to enterprise portals through desktop computers. Coach sought to reach employees wherever they were through an easy-to-use intranet accessible via mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. In doing so, employees could quickly and easily find the information they need.     Coach\u2019s vision for creating a digital workplace was to make it as easy to use as possible, preventing frustration concerning interactions with work documentation. Through consolidation on Coachweb, employees do not need to move from site to site or remember numerous passwords to access important information, removing the burden on the employee.     In addition, employees are now able to communicate more directly with headquarters, receiving information on products and providing feedback based on customer actions in stores.     Embracing Digital Transformation     Following success in enterprise intranet implementation, Coach additionally built their VM Insights site to streamline and improve their visual merchandising in stores worldwide using Liferay. The global fashion company is looking to continue improving their backend system integration and further digital transformation in all aspects of their business.     Coachweb has allowed the company to decentralize content management and avoid the time-consuming process of rebuilding their content by simply replicating it online when necessary. When combined with document consolidation, Coach has been able to be efficient in how they spend their time and money on internal processes.     Coach is also planning on creating apps to meet employee needs and develop closer coordination between regions around the world based on their digital platform.","keywords":["Coach, Inc.","employees","Coach","intranet","human resources questions","Liferay","employees","accessories","employees","employees","employees","stores","content","documents","intranet","content management system","employees","employee systems","smartphones","luxury","brand","Coachweb","updates","team members","realm","expansions","URLs","information","employee intranet","Coach","stores","fashion company","Coach","Coach","store employees","information","company","company","employees","employees","Employees","Coach","customers","company","Coach","confusion","tablets","ability","connection","information","employees","information","information","capabilities","content","software","employees","employee","site","answers","employee news","document","documents","employees","process","stores","desktop computers","way","platform","company","information","regions","customers","needs","platform","needs","Workplace","confusion","world","policies","ability","devices","information","cornerstone","questions","Coach","version","difficulty","creation","search functionality","amount","features","transformation efforts","dashboard","ecosystem","future","technology","database","Content Due","self-service","earnings reports","offices","messages","CEO","business strategies","smartphone usage","age","enterprise portals","transformation","backend system integration","information","employees","content","burden","customer actions","products","headquarters","addition","merchandising","enterprise intranet implementation","success","Coach","employees","platform","employee needs","business","content management","document consolidation","processes","world","HR","feedback","aspects","money","apps","coordination","intranet","work documentation","VM Insights","Digital Transformation Following","Coachweb","smartphones","workplace","site","site","tablets","devices","interactions","consolidation","vision","frustration","passwords"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=suez","text":"SUEZ is a global resource management company.

The group offers a wide range of financial solutions in Life Assurance, General Insurance, Health Insurance, Retirement Planning, Asset Management and Property.   In 2012, Britam launched an ambitious IT-enabled business transformation project known as Jawabu, aimed at achieving the following goals:     In short, Britam needed to build a digital experience platform that would serve as the foundation of its transformation and enable the company to tackle common obstacles across its various businesses.   Vision for Digital Transformation     The digital transformation at Britam is a combination of changes to IT systems at every level, ranging from the underlying line of business systems, to databases and digital engagement services. The company wanted to identify common applications that were used across insurance portals and package them into a single application repository to reuse across customer touchpoints. Uniting departments in order to develop a holistic view of the customer experience became a key focus of Britam's digital transformation.     In addition, the company saw many common obstacles that needed to be overcome in order to truly transform:           Multiple homegrown systems that were ill-equipped to share data      Existing line of business systems couldn\u2019t keep pace with the changing business environment      Agent broker experience was manual and time-consuming      No online integration with Britam partners          After assessing several leading portal solutions and digital experience platforms, Britam decided on Liferay. The solution offered a single platform that could meet needs horizontally across multiple use cases and contexts, all within a single technology environment.

The portal provides self-service capabilities and enables the sales force to manage its client portfolio independently.      Customer Service Portal : Customers can access self-service options for Britam's Life business products in a single, unified interface, and more products will be added gradually.      Market Place : Britam customers can now do their own quotations and purchase Marine Insurance policies from the Britam Market Place.      Partner Service Portal : Marine Insurance brokers and agents can now do quotations, manage the purchase of Marine Insurance policies and access self-service options. Financial brokers, doctors, health advisors, travel agents and other Britam extended partners can access a full shop of Marine business applications.      Seven Corporate Websites : Each Britam region has its own website, with multilingual capabilities and a common content management system using Liferay.      Corporate Intranet : A new and revamped intranet, called Britam Connect, which allows the organization to collaborate and share in a fresh and exciting way.               Many portals and core systems are within a Single Sign On environment, and benefit from centralized identity management with OpenLDAP, OpenAM and Cisco ISE integration. The remaining portal systems are being gradually onboarded in order to achieve the goal of a fully unified platform.     The connected portals function as the presentation layer, implemented on top of the integration layer, business services layer and core business systems. As core platforms are installed and modified, the services are constantly changing and new features are being deployed in phases. By decoupling the integrated services layer and the overall system, Britam is able to maintain a modern presentation portal for customers, partners, site visitors and employees, while pulling in new services as soon as they\u2019re available.     New Era of Convenience     Britam\u2019s new digital experience platform has been rolled out with exceptional success, and in 2015 earned the company the CIO 100 Award for East Africa. Britam sees this as a new era of convenience for its users, with improved business processes, enhanced structures and state-of-the-art IT systems that position the company for future growth.     Britam is already witnessing benefits that would not have been possible without the new systems. For instance, Financial Advisors now have customer intelligence that allows them to focus on analysis instead of data crunching, and eliminates decisions that are made according to \u201cgut feelings\u201d instead of tangible facts. Financial Advisors now sell more and service their customers better, with near 100% adoption of the new portal. Britam has also drastically reduced the cost of customer service through its self-service site, which can be accessed on any mobile device.     The new corporate intranet, Britam Connect, has seen a similar jump in user adoption. The increase in active users has fueled a collaborative culture that supports the ongoing digital transformation strategy and ensures everyone remains informed of its progress. With the steady rollout of more sites, Britam is transforming its digital experiences one step at a time, ultimately leading to better relationships with its customers.     One of the company\u2019s primary goals was enabling growth in profitability across regions, and this IT transformation has made it possible to scale and expand. The company is now ready with the necessary capabilities to respond to requirements from new, incoming customers, further enabling their regional and local growth strategy.     Positioned for Future Growth     With Liferay, Britam built an integrated, future-proof strategic digital platform that is reliable, secure and flexible. Looking forward, Britam hopes that its digital journeys can be further explored for customers, partners and agents with its interconnected platform. Content and applications will be more contextualized and targeted to the right end users.     Britam is currently planning an upgrade to Liferay DXP, and is excited to implement the following features to take its transformation even further:           A new microservices-based approach      Improved technical architecture      A stronger focus on digital engagement      The ability to scale as the business grows      New features that help its team sell more and serve customers better          \"Liferay has been a technology partner for Britam in its journey toward digital transformation,\" says Maina. \"What defines a digital experience platform isn't just features and tools. It's the ability to bring your entire organization together and achieve new levels of efficiency, through sophisticated integration, reusable components and unified design. Digital experience platforms get everyone on the same page, and Liferay has exceeded our expectations in achieving this.\"","keywords":["group","Liferay","experience platform","transformation","combination","platform","Intranet","services","Britam","applications","businesses","IT systems","business systems","transformation","systems","Digital Transformation The","General Insurance","company","Asset Management","goals","presence","solutions","databases","Nairobi Securities Exchange","customers","business transformation project","users","Life Assurance","obstacles","level","line","customers","policies","countries","Retirement Planning","Property","foundation","changes","range","obstacles","Health Insurance","customers","solution","portals","customer details","engagement services","experience platforms","insurance portals","business systems","customer experience","transformation","business environment Agent broker experience","company","company","Advisors","Tanzania","Malawi","Uganda","Mozambique","Kenya","South Sudan","Rwanda","Jawabu","customer intelligence","integration","partners","platform","contexts","culture","technology environment","line","Customers","order","platform","solutions","order","data","Integrated Digital Experience Platform","Partner Service Portal","content management system","systems","Financial Advisor Portal","portal","client portfolio","Customer Service Portal","services","portals","platform","core platforms","services","experience platform","focus","company","systems","business systems","portals","system","presentation portal","quotations","quotations","Life Assurance quotations","interface","partners","business applications","applications","customer touchpoints","application repository","view","departments","applications","East Africa","addition","needs","use cases","integration","health advisors","company","Advisors","content","company","partners","single","agents","travel agents","pace","environment","region","environments","sites","transformation goals","management","customers","experience platforms","customers","platform","self-service options","brokers","brokers","capabilities","option","self-service options","identity management","goal","integration layer","business services layer","presentation layer","features","services layer","business contexts","One","transformation","experiences","IT transformation","company","order","Life business products","products","Market Place","website","Websites","organization","Marine Insurance","site visitors","Jack Maina","partners","purchase","doctors","shop","way","reuse","enterprises","implementation","help","users","everyone","self-service capabilities","sites","goals","Growth","agents","top","phases","decoupling","employees","success","customers","engagement platform","experience platform","decisions","capabilities","sales force","Content","transformation","expectations","features","business","components","growth","Marine","strategy","regions","policy details","integration","applications","everyone","progress","rollout","step","relationships","profitability","requirements","end users","Britam Market Place","growth strategy","features","features","OpenAM","OpenLDAP","engagement","Single Sign On","GCOO","InfoAxon","customers","customer service","ability","focus","journey","levels","ability","Cisco ISE","CIO 100 Award","IT systems","systems","portal","company","journeys","upgrade","architecture","approach","tools","design","efficiency","page","organization","team","growth","self-service site","intranet","convenience","adoption","user adoption","business processes","structures","benefits","instance","analysis","data crunching","gut feelings","facts","cost","mobile device","jump","increase","Liferay DXP"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=avmed","text":"Formerly Aviation Medicine, AvMed began in 1969 as a niche healthcare insurance provider for the growing aviation industry in Miami, Florida. Today, AvMed provides commercial, individual and Medicare health coverage to more than 380,000 Floridians in over 30 counties throughout the state.   Customer service has always been the heart of AvMed\u2019s mission. But with a legacy website that wasn\u2019t yet mobile-ready, AvMed needed to update its IT process and user experience. Using Liferay, AvMed partnered with Rivet Logic to optimize the login experience and create an appealing site design. The new website consolidated three legacy properties (avmed.org, Medicare and Embrace Better Health) into one homepage. These changes increased digital engagement, encouraged new site traffic and decreased customer support costs\u2014all while leading AvMed to become truly customer-centric.   Designing a Digital Storefront     In order to provide a terrific customer experience, new processes were required. Recognizing that AvMed\u2019s members wanted a functional mobile experience, they planned for a site redesign to meet the change in customer needs. AvMed wanted a central, user-friendly website with portals for each type of user. To bridge the silo between IT and marketing, they needed a platform with WCM capabilities. Before, any content update required adjustment to the source code, meaning the marketing department was unable to edit and publish content themselves.     \u201cThe [legacy] website was built from the inside out,\u201d said Ana Eberhard, AvMed\u2019s Vice President of Member Experience. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t needs-driven. If you had any content that you needed to change, you needed to get IT involved.\u201d     Further, it lacked what she called a digital storefront, a clear presentation of AvMed\u2019s services and brand identity. The unappealing design was enough to limit new business and discouraged existing members from engaging with the brand.     These pain points illustrate how customer needs encouraged AvMed to invest in new technology. More than a health insurance provider, AvMed\u2019s Wellfluent\u2122 brand provides resources to the public for tips and news on wellness and healthy living. After the site updates, current and past resources were easier to search and find. AvMed was able to better market their content and services to interested and invested parties.     Scalable Benefits Without IT Involvement     Using Liferay, AvMed designed four unique user portals to improve the site\u2019s design and functionality. Now, logging on to the new site through Single sign on (SSO) asserts that customers are experiencing a much less cumbersome process. Redesigning the journey through the lens of the customer experience meant implementing a phased approach. With an IT support staff of less than 10, the flexibility of tackling projects separately (i.e., separating the portals) was essential.     \u201cWe appreciated that building [AvMed] on Liferay made it scalable,\u201d Eberhard said.     Because of the easy-to-use nature of Liferay, AvMed and Rivet Logic were able to launch the first new portal in just a few months, with future plans to modernize the three remaining portals. Because Liferay was designed for integration, a number of helpful third-party applications were supported on the new site, including a translation engine to provide a Spanish version of the site, and a web accessibility tool making content screen reader compatible.     And by utilizing Liferay\u2019s Asset Publisher, content across the site became easier to use through the use of categories and tags. With a clean dashboard, relevant information surfaced right away. For instance, updating personal information could be accomplished quickly in a snapshot that was easy to find. No longer did changing content for the marketing team require IT support, a costly and cumbersome process. From a customer perspective, the new site makes much more sense for the user.     Immediate ROI     The results were significant. Site visits (and time spent on the site) increased immediately after the Q4 redesign to more than 20,000 unique visitors per month from the following year. Call center volume dropped, saving AvMed almost $40,000 dollars within one quarter of measurement. But more importantly, the customer experience improved. A portlet called \u201cShow Me the Math\u201d helped members understand the cost breakdown per event between what they paid and what AvMed paid. This transparency isn\u2019t just a better business practice, the optimized communication has helped decrease costly customer support calls.     Of course, no website is ever finished. But the modular benefit to using Liferay makes future work easier. Where the legacy site required maintenance downtime, the new website is always live with 24x7 uptime.     \"We needed to build on a platform that allowed the experience to undergo continual enhancement and improvement,\u201d Eberhard said, \u201cand that's what we have now.\u201d","keywords":["AvMed","IT","website","Customer service","legacy website","site","Liferay","avmed.org","healthcare insurance provider","aviation industry","user experience","login experience","Aviation Medicine","Florida","IT process","site design","Miami","state","counties","mission","content","Medicare","health coverage","platform","snapshot","Floridians","Ana Eberhard","processes","experience","portals","website","content update","user","content","members","site","site","marketing","customer experience","changes","customer support costs","Storefront","customer needs","change","site redesign","legacy site","experience","content","Rivet Logic","portal","content","user portals","homepage","engagement","website","customer experience","order","type","silo","design","portals","members","process","legacy","storefront","brand","brand","services","design","services","customers","Embrace Better Health","business","health insurance provider","wellness","public","site updates","parties","Benefits","presentation","marketing department","site traffic","customer experience","flexibility","technology","pain points","living","news","tips","IT Involvement","functionality","capabilities","source code","inside","brand identity","customer needs","user","platform","process","sign","journey","lens","approach","projects","IT support staff","building","nature","resources","portlet","members","communication","visitors","Site visits","redesign","Eberhard","Call center volume","website","marketing team","customer perspective","measurement","transparency","business practice","WellfluentTM","WCM","benefit","sense","SSO","Single","resources","adjustment","cost breakdown","event","customer support calls","course","work","uptime","improvement","enhancement","content","IT support","portals","Q4","Show Me the Math","number","use","information","information","ROI","results","plans","integration","applications","web accessibility tool","content screen reader","tags","categories","dashboard","instance","maintenance downtime","version","Asset Publisher","translation engine","Spanish"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=airbus","text":"Open Source is definitely a priority for Airbus.

To increase motivation and efficiency among the teams, the Airbus Aircraft division decided to consolidate its ITSM tools into one user-centric solution.

The bank is a pioneer among traditional banks in India when it comes to using technology to manage its operations. Federal Bank was also among the first banks in India to computerize its branches. Today, the bank offers its customers a variety of services such as internet banking, mobile banking, online bill payment, online fee collection, depository services, cash management services, merchant banking services, insurance, mutual fund products, and much more, as part of its strategy to position itself as a financial super market and to provide its customers the best-in-class experience.   Customer Experiences Hindered by Legacy     A major roadblock to providing customers with the best customer experience possible was the custom-built legacy website based on dated .net technology. The old website was mainly informative, lacking even the basic actionable features needed by a bank, such as loan applications, opening an account, and call back request. Even basic changes to the content and layout needed exhaustive alterations to the code and in-depth knowledge of HTML. There was no support available for running dynamic campaigns to drive brand awareness and generate leads. Further, there were major issues with website stability, as the site often went down with the slightest increase in load.     New Modern Website Places Bank Ahead of Competitors     When the vendor responsible for maintaining the legacy website closed shop, Federal Bank realized that it was time to look for better and future-proof options. After considering multiple options, some of which were already being used at the bank, Liferay was chosen based on its ranking as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals, and a strong recommendation from the consultant supporting Federal Bank with vendor selection.     Although the bank was wary of using open-source- based technology considering the industry they operate in, these fears were allayed by the portal\u2019s adherence to strictest security norms, and its ability to be customized and integrated with an array of third-party systems.     Liferay supported Federal Bank in identifying and implementing all key functionalities needed in a modern banking website. Liferay also helped in migrating all relevant content from the legacy platform. Custom templates were created for the bank which could later be used to manage content using simple drag-and-drop. The website was also integrated with other internal systems including the CRM and the customer-service portal. Post implementation, Liferay helped the bank understand the portal, and the possibilities that come with it, in detail. The association has helped the bank in providing new features to its customers on a yearly basis, and to stay ahead of the competition.     Gaining New Customer Insights     The most immediate impact of migrating to Liferay was the freeing up of IT and development bandwidth to focus on more strategic initiatives. As Sooraj Bhat, Senior Manager Digital at Federal Bank puts it, \u201cWe realized how much we could achieve with so little development efforts.\u201d The custom templates made website authoring and content management faster and more efficient. Mobile support meant that the website could be updated from anywhere, anytime, in a hassle-free way. The multi-server architecture also helped in boosting the website stability, and significantly reducing the maintenance hassles. The website availability is 99.9% (against a target of 99.5%).     The bank was also able to host all dynamic campaigns on the website, turning it into a powerful business tool for generating business and capturing precious customer insights through integration with their analytics platform. The portal\u2019s personalization capabilities and its support for quick SEO and meta tag management also enabled the bank to push the most relevant offers to its various customer segments. Use of features such as calendar and blogs, quick SEO capabilities and meta tag management has resulted in a significant uptick in the daily number of hits and the time spent on the website. The bank has since had to upgrade the infrastructure to support the increased number of users.     The Way Forward     Federal Bank is now planning to upgrade to the latest version of Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP) to provide its customers an even better experience. Presently, the bank uses social media for amplifying the content on the website. With Liferay DXP, the bank would be able to leverage social logins and capture deeper insights about their customers. Liferay DXP would also help the bank in pushing the most relevant offers to its customers and in personalizing the experience for its different customer segments.","keywords":["pioneer","Liferay","Federal Bank Limited","bank","customers","bank","bank","branches","banks","banks","mobile banking","internet banking","sector","customers","depository services","cash management services","services","merchant banking services","branches","technology","Indian","ATMs","Kerala","Aluva","website","portal","operations","insurance","fund","products","bill payment","fee collection","variety","portal","bank","Way Forward Federal Bank","website","legacy website","account","options","Customer Experiences","templates","Website Places Bank","customers","customer experience","content","banking website","legacy website","more","technology","features","website","experience","part","offers","Post implementation","association","market","strategy","roadblock","request","loan applications","layout","changes","code","content","support","site","campaigns","content","customer-service portal","portal","some","technology","alterations","legacy platform","personalization capabilities","Leader","Customer Insights","systems","leads","website stability","options","vendor","Competitors","experience","systems","competition","ranking","vendor selection","consultant","recommendation","array","ability","security norms","adherence","industry","fears","functionalities","HTML","knowledge","brand awareness","load","increase","meta tag management","meta tag management","customers","campaigns","drag-and-drop","detail","possibilities","basis","impact","website","Legacy A","features","analytics platform","customer insights","support","features","integration","business","SEO","customer segments","number","SEO capabilities","shop","business tool","calendar","Use","blogs","uptick","hits","content","DXP","CRM","insights","Gartner Magic Quadrant for Horizontal Portals","website","number","experience","customer segments","architecture","infrastructure","users","version","social media","logins","issues","content management","website availability","DXP","development","Senior Manager Digital","way","maintenance hassles","website stability","support","bandwidth","IT","initiatives","development efforts","website authoring","anywhere","target","Sooraj Bhat"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=eatel","text":"EATEL Business is a Louisiana-based provider of business-technology solutions and telecommunication services, with hundreds of local businesses connected to their fiber internet service.

The Digital Education Team wanted to build a platform to provide school students, teachers and parents with access to an online library of educational resources aligned to the Australian Curriculum.   Liferay was chosen because of the light-weight, open standard web platform and flexibility to enable rapid development.   Choosing the platform     A critical success factor in the deployment of the project was the short time to deliver. The flexibility of the Liferay platform and out-of-the-box functionality were key factors in the selection of Liferay and enabled ABC Digital Education to meet their target delivery dates.     There was a rapid implementation, from signing in June to a live product in just over five months with 300 pieces of content live from day one. ABC Education now has more than 4000 pieces of content.     The Liferay platform provides flexibility and extensibility for building customised functionality and capacity for future extension and integration. Many features required for the ABC Education digital platform, such as social media capabilities, are supported out of the box, so significantly less development resources and time are required to develop.     Project aims and vision     A significant amount of the content delivered on ABC Education is rich video and audio materials and live events, therefore, the site needed to be delivered on a light-weight, open standard web platform which would enable rapid development and flexibility.     The site also needed to appeal to a broad audience, students ranging in age from five to 16, teachers and parents, and have organised and searchable content delivered in an engaging way for all users.     In addition, the digital platform needed to:     \u2022 Use and promote the capability of the National Broadband Network     \u2022 Provide engaging and immersive digital learning experiences to engage students and parents in the home     \u2022 Deliver a wealth of digital media clips, content and interactive tools which align to the Australian national curriculum     \u2022 Ensure the ABC fulfils its charter obligation to educate and inform Australians     The destination for Australian education     ABC Education offers a world-class education experience and all resources are free to watch and play at home and in school and guaranteed to spark discussion and promote curiosity.     Development within the Liferay framework ensured a consistent and predictable output and reduced management overhead. The Liferay technology has enabled the ABC team to continually update the site and now some time on from when the site launched it is still fresh and engaging for students, teachers and parents who visit the site regularly.     ABC Education has become an indispensable resource to help transform learning in the classroom. For students, it is the go to place for helpful,     fun and informative content in a world that is media rich and a space to create and collaborate.

Adama\u2019s team of over 6,000 employees provides farmers with solutions \u2014 herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, plant growth regulators and seed treatments \u2013 that improve the quality and quantity of their crop yields by protecting them from weeds, insects and diseases.   With a heritage going back 70 years, Adama is one of the largest companies in the $60 billion global crop protection industry and the only integrated Global-China crop protection company, with sales in 2016 of $3.35 billion.   Reimagining an Aging Solution     In order to stay relevant to its customer base, Adama decided to roll out a comprehensive rebrand to its corporate website. This included more than 50 local country sites, as well as micro product sites in about 40 languages. The entire public website would remain online, but the look and feel of every page needed to be updated according to the new guidelines.     To achieve this, Adama\u2019s team introduced an ambitious digital roadmap that would allow them to implement the new sites without interrupting day-to-day operations. The team needed to manage simultaneous training as well for nearly 100 web editors spread across the globe so they could continue to publish new content during the migration period. This made the introduction of the new platform even more challenging.     The company quickly realized that the existing Content Management System (CMS) wasn\u2019t up to the task. It was too time-consuming to migrate content and had a poor user experience for web editors.     Adama decided to replace the legacy CMS with the Liferay platform, which provided the necessary flexibility and customizations along with high scalability and excellent user experience.     A Future-Proof Digital Foundation     Together with its strategic partner PRODYNA, Adama developed the solution on Liferay with an agile approach. It was critical to develop the customized CMS features in Liferay and to migrate the existing content seamlessly without any downtime to the new site.     During the project, the team discovered more than 30 different web components, 20 different page templates, and 10 custom applications and forms that needed to be available in Liferay. The team was able to develop all these requested features with Liferay\u2019s out-of-the-box functionality, such as Web Content Structures, predefined Page Templates and a Contact Us Portlet. Leveraging the existing functionality made it much faster to implement the new CMS, since the team had to create very little from scratch. One of the greatest gains was the instant publishing feature, which would enable Adama to reach its customers in a matter of seconds.     Furthermore, third-party solutions such as ADFS for Single-Sign-On or the Asset Management Platform PicturePark were integrated into Adama\u2019s solution, allowing the team to maintain its current processes for identity management and its digital product catalog.     The team orchestrated the existing content migration and web editor training in four region-based waves. PRODYNA trained each wave onsite with a professional and experienced trainer, based on step-by-step documentation that was created during the project development.     After their training, web editors reviewed the migrated content page by page and approved the overall migration for each site. Once the site owners gave the final approval, the migrated pages were published and swapped using an intelligent configuration of the existing load balancer.     In addition to the onsite training, PRODYNA introduced a multilingual service desk to ensure that web editors could reach out to somebody in case they got stuck during any of the new CMS processes.     Finally, to encourage momentum and ensure that web editors feel supported, the team runs bi-monthly training webinars, focusing on new features or questions that editors have asked.     Improved User Experience for Employees and Customers     The Liferay platform provides Adama with more flexibility and empowers its web editors to create custom pages based on their local needs while following the global brand guidelines. Today, Adama is able to deliver personalized online experiences to its customers faster without concern that one region will present a different brand look than others. Customers are able to easily review Adama\u2019s products on a modern, user-friendly site that integrates features like live chat to offer help as soon as they need it.     Adama has more features planned for its corporate site, which can be easily implemented based on the out-of-the-box functionality of Liferay and enhanced with custom portlets, ensuring that Adama has exactly the CMS it needs for its business.     \u201cLiferay is an innovative and user-friendly platform that provides the necessary scalability and flexibility we were looking for to reach our digital goals,\u201d says Georgiana Francescotti, part of the Information & Digital Technology team at Adama.

The team planned to create a single page in its mobile app that would enable users to take eclipse-specific measurements.     As the eclipse approached, the number of new users steadily increased, adding about 50,000 new users to the system in total \u2014 far more than the team had anticipated. The team used the identity management features within Liferay to manage the new additions, which were tagged with a particular role so they could keep track of who was coming in through the eclipse project.     A week before the eclipse, the GLOBE team came up with the idea of displaying the aggregated observation data on a map that showed the path of the eclipse across the U.S. Users could move a time slider left to right and see the temperature data show up on the map as the eclipse progressed.     SSAI\u2019s development team was able to build the map and put it up within a week, and it instantly became popular. Several of the NASA centers had it displayed throughout the day and it was picked up on some of the news coverage of the eclipse.     In the end, over 100,000 measurements were taken during the eclipse with the GLOBE Observer app, a massive spike relative to normal operations.     Driving Scientific Engagement     With Liferay, GLOBE Observer was able to act quickly on an idea that contributed to its mission: Giving citizen scientists of all ages the opportunity to participate in the scientific process, and by doing so, contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment.     \u201cOnce our developers understand the Liferay platform, they can modify it to do anything,\u201d says Dave Overoye, Project Manager for the GLOBE website. \u201cLiterally anything.\u201d This flexibility is a strong advantage as he works to balance the requirements of stakeholders from around the world.

That ranges from ambulatory guidance to very intensive care.   \u201cWe are dealing with strict safety requirements and the privacy of our clients is very important,\u201d said Claire Dubelaar, Senior Online Communication Advisor.   In 2013, Philadelphia faced the challenge of setting up a portal to connect disparate systems in a single site. The foundation had many requirements to meet, including integration with the existing applications. After several discussions with its implementation partner Componence, Philadelphia selected the Liferay platform for the project. Since then, the following sites have been completed: Intranet (website and native app); Community site (for employees, volunteers); Corporate website; and My Philadelphia (for employees, volunteers, clients).   Anywhere, Anytime, Any Device     The first project was to redesign the intranet, known as Phlink. A primary goal was to give ambulatory employees access to business information on location, regardless of the time, place or device. For example, during a meeting with a client, employees may need to retrieve protocols or information from colleagues. The new intranet website and mobile app helps employees so they can always provide more effective and efficient care.     With support from Componence, the intranet project was completed in just three months. Philadelphia also launched a new community site called \u201cHey, I Have an Idea\u201d that serves as a platform for both employees and volunteers. Users can start discussions with each other, ask questions around case histories or legislation, visit the marketplace, and post blogs and vlogs. This way, all stakeholders stay more involved in the health care process and improvements.     The Right Content for Every Audience     Across all these projects, I&A (the IT Department) wanted to consolidate platforms instead of continuing to maintain disparate systems. The Liferay platform was able to act as a central hub that distributes content to each different target group and channel. Each target group has its own information needs and Liferay facilitates this both via the web and via native apps.     Philadelphia has seen major benefits from consolidating technologies; it is now safer and easier to manage its sites at a lower cost. The content within the systems is dynamic as well. The information that stakeholders need at each moment is now baked into the design of Philadelphia\u2019s digital landscape, and the content is adapted to each need. Additionally, the group has seen positive growth in the number of clients, employees and volunteers for Philadelphia, which it attributes to the new websites.","keywords":["Philadelphia","people","selves","disabilities","target group","Philadelphia Care Foundation","foundation","clients","clients","care","Philadelphia","privacy","Componence","locations","disabilities","safety requirements","employees","guidance","Claire Dubelaar","Netherlands","intranet website","site","Liferay","foundation","systems","hub","requirements","discussions","employees","employees","employees","employees","community site","portal","challenge","applications","website","platform","employees","client","clients","sites","Community site","information","business information","information","project","volunteers","Intranet","volunteers","website","intranet","project","Device","intranet project","platform","volunteers","number","Users","device","location","app","goal","app","content","content","discussions","place","colleagues","protocols","example","meeting","Anywhere","integration","sites","care","support","legislation","case histories","each other","questions","systems","information needs","access","employees","channel","apps","web","benefits","cost","technologies","clients","content","websites","volunteers","I Have an Idea","group","Phlink","need","stakeholders","Hey","landscape","design","growth","platform","Content","projects","platforms","marketplace","systems","stakeholders","blogs","vlogs","way","health care process","improvements","Audience","I&A","IT Department"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=maiden-reinsurance","text":"Maiden Global Servicing Company is dedicated to delivering a customer-centric strategy to support the reinsurance and capital needs of regional and specialty insurers. Maiden provides customized, non-catastrophic reinsurance solutions and other forms of long-term capital support. The company works collaboratively with clients to gain an in-depth understanding of their business and offer customized solutions.   Maiden\u2019s Portal 360 project was created to move from an aging, monolithic site to a dynamic, responsive web experience providing both common and specific content for several business units.   High-level problems with the existing intranet included the site consisting of a single page full of links, an inability to search content and an out-of-date appearance. In addition, although Maiden is separated into multiple organizations, all information was presented on a single site, with only limited permissioning and no targeting.   Maiden\u2019s Portal 360 project had numerous key features that they hoped to implement through a new portal. These included single sign-on and identity federation capabilities, modern responsive user interface, creation and maintenance of separate subsidiary sites, role-specific search capabilities and open source support for Active Directory integration, OAuth authentication with J2EE applications and dynamic content based on user security profile.   Building Powerful Content     Maiden reviewed portal solutions by leveraging the Gartner Magic Quadrant and discussing requirements with a Gartner analyst. After Liferay was determined to be the best fit, Maiden underwent a proof of concept with XTIVIA.     \u201cWe knew we needed a strong implementation partner to assist us,\u201d said John Sharp, Senior Vice President of IT at Maiden. \u201cWe chose XTIVIA based on their extensive track record of successful Liferay implementation projects. The XTIVIA team provided true consulting and partnered with our business representatives and IT leadership to quickly assess our needs to deliver a new intranet.\u201d     The intranet enabled Maiden to target relevant content and assets within six different companies to specific groups. It also allowed integration with external content and data.     \u201cThe Liferay platform provides a solid foundation with a lot of flexibility for Maiden to use for many years to come. We see a lot of value in being able to leverage Liferay\u2019s core features to build and maintain our own sites and applications,\u201d said Sharp.     In the first phase of building on Liferay DXP, Maiden focused primarily on the internal employee intranet. Since Liferay already has the core components required for logins, role-based access controls, page creation, site look and feel, web content management, audience targeting and other features, Maiden can leverage these capabilities without the need to build everything from scratch.     Today, employees say the site is a major improvement and Maiden has been able to internally prove out Active Directory integration and content management before implementing it on a customer-facing website to ensure success.","keywords":["Powerful Content Maiden","company","needs","reinsurance","capital","project","strategy","insurers","specialty","Maiden Global Servicing Company","Liferay","XTIVIA","business","solutions","capital support","forms","clients","understanding","improvement","reinsurance solutions","John Sharp","features","content","site","site","core","intranet","content","sites","Portal 360","problems","Active Directory","page","content","subsidiary sites","site","web experience","aging","business units","appearance","links","inability","integration","user interface","search capabilities","portal","capabilities","fit","access controls","implementation projects","J2EE applications","open source support","creation","IT","solutions","authentication","user security profile","requirements","analyst","addition","organizations","targeting","identity","maintenance","sign-on","federation","employee intranet","building","components","proof","concept","track record","IT leadership","business representatives","team","information","everything","applications","implementation partner","page creation","consulting","value","phase","site look","logins","XTIVIA","Gartner","intranet","need","capabilities","OAuth","Gartner Magic Quadrant","Maiden","web content management","features","content management","content","content","integration","feel","audience","scratch","website","success","intranet","companies","integration","needs","lot","lot","groups","assets","data","platform","flexibility","foundation","employees"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=eatel-customer-portal","text":"EATEL is a family-owned and operated communications company who has served Louisiana for more than 80 years. In addition, EATEL Business operates two commercial data centers offering colocation, private cloud, data backup and recovery services to the business community throughout the United States.   EATEL needed a responsive, self-service customer portal to support its residential and business customers, providing a complete view of the customer\u2019s relationship and allow for selfservice capabilities that interface with a variety of back-end systems\/platforms. The vision for this portal was to be forward-looking and customizable to change with evolving service offerings, as well as being able to bring together various services and offerings of the EATEL ecosystem.     EATEL had already used Liferay DXP to create a new website and, after their successful launch, planned to use Liferay to also build their customer portal. In comparison to other options, EATEL saw the Liferay platform as a visionary leader and the right fit.     Using Liferay DXP with Liferay\u2019s Platinum Partner, XTIVIA, EATEL was able to meet their objectives and had an extremely successful launch, with the company seeing it as \u201cone of the most successful projects we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d That success included reduced customer service calls, greater accessibility through responsive design, flexible account management in a single login, reduced billing and payment issues, better self-service options in a single location and better marketing and customer communication center.     \u201cIn our first phase of building on the Liferay DXP platform, we focused primarily on applications to interface with our core Customer Information Systems,\u201d said Aubry Henkel, Director, IS\/IT\/PMO at EATEL. \u201cSince Liferay already has the core components required for registrations, logins, role-based access controls, page creation, site look and feel, web content management, audience targeting, and so many other features, we can leverage these capabilities without the need to build everything from scratch.\u201d     EATEL partnered with XTIVIA to leverage Liferay DXP\u2019s core features along with a modern React Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. Additionally, they used XTIVIA\u2019s JetRay architecture pattern to expedite custom React portlet development and integrate with Dell Boomi based RESTful services. The implementation process leveraged an Agile development methodology.     \u201cXTIVIA has been great to work with. They managed the project well, always communicating regarding scope and budget so there would be no surprises. With so many Liferay experts, every request was met with knowledgeable responses. But most importantly, rather than prioritizing their sales pipeline, they focused on educating our technical team at EATEL so that we could learn and grow in providing our own Liferay solutions in the future,\u201d said Henkel. EATEL\u2019s project ended with a successful launch of the Liferay DXP-based Customer Portal to production.     Modernizing the Customer Experience     Users can select relevant accounts and statements through the portal and, if the user has multiple accounts or statements, can easily switch from one account to another. User dashboards provide snapshots of account-related information and the ability to navigate among three groups of features: Billing, Support and Services and Account Settings. EATEL uses Liferay DXP to facilitate everything from the overall look and feel to integrating applications that make it possible for secure payments.     The portal quickly caused a reduction in call volume for data centers. More than 50% of calls coming into the residential call center were payment related, but the user-based account management approach and simplified interactions reduced such calls by 30%. With younger customers reluctant to make a phone call, having an online interface helped engage with a key segment who previously did not interact. Business customers love the control that they now have over contacts, permissions and more from their own login instead of calling in with each request.     \u201cThe flexibility of Liferay has been key,\u201d Henkel said. \u201cSo much of the portal is editable by non-developers, allowing us to focus our most technical internal resources on the intricacies of integrations and highly advanced content pages. This also enables us to be quick to market with offers and promotions that might have taken up to a month to reach users through other means.\u201d     In the near future, EATEL plans to introduce many more customer-friendly features, including \u201cKnowledge Base,\u201d view\/manage data center asset features and SSO connectivity for key service platforms like EATEL cloud portal, alarm.com and other services.","keywords":["EATEL","Liferay","DXP","PMO","Business customers","company","customer","customers","self-service","services","portal","customer portal","platforms","EATEL Business","business","business community","Louisiana","data backup","cloud","selfservice capabilities","systems","vision","Henkel","customer portal","recovery","colocation","addition","relationship","variety","core","project","view","United States","XTIVIA","control","Aubry Henkel","services","platform","comparison","everything","services","data centers","service offerings","offerings","launch","launch","options","offers","ecosystem","customer service calls","website","leader","fit","objectives","interface","access controls","customer communication center","platform","components","features","customers","web content management","logins","projects","React portlet development","payment","login","account management","applications","building","success","project","site look","capabilities","architecture","launch","one","accessibility","marketing","self-service options","billing","Customer Information Systems","surprises","account management approach","portal","flexibility","architecture pattern","experts","request","scope","calls","calls","scratch","registrations","page creation","feel","audience","need","location","issues","design","IT","phase","data centers","call center","contacts","implementation process","Agile development methodology","budget","responses","team","sales pipeline","XTIVIA","DXP","Platinum Partner","payment","interactions","login","features","services","phone call","portal","cloud portal","request","React Single Page Application","solutions","segment","permissions","users","service platforms","data center asset features","integrations","content pages","SPA","Dell","Boomi","RESTful","JetRay","IS","much","market","Services","Customer Portal","portal","user","intricacies","resources","non-developers","promotions","means","connectivity","account","accounts","Customer Experience Users","features","statements","statements","payments","applications","50%","accounts","information","Billing","look","everything","Knowledge Base","production","another","Account Settings","Support","groups","ability","User dashboards","reduction","call volume","SSO","alarm.com","snapshots"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=york-university","text":"Founded in 1959, York University is now Canada\u2019s third largest university and world renowned for attracting students who forge their own unique paths to success. York offers full and part-time graduate and undergraduate degree programs to   almost 55,000 students through 10 faculties. For an institution of York University\u2019s size, keeping its students engaged and involved is crucial to retention. So when students began to voice frustration about making sense of all the content and tools available to them on York\u2019s website, York set new technological goals to remedy their pains.   It was decided that a portal would be the best functional and technological fit by pulling together course schedules, grades, financial information, library account status and campus news in one centralized hub. York needed a high degree of flexibility in a portal framework. Issues like standards compliance and the need for extensive application integration drove their eventual selection of Liferay Portal for its SOA design and adherence to open standards.   \u201cWe found that we were better served by an open source solution as it allowed us to understand it thoroughly before we made a full commitment,\u201d said Peter Rowley, Director of Applications and Integration in University Information Technology, York\u2019s central IT organization.   With the portal presenting a wide variety of content and tools, ease of use was paramount.   \u201cLiferay\u2019s simple user interface was key to the portal being adopted by a large audience of students who didn\u2019t have time to be trained,\u201d said Kate Stewart, an independent consultant on the project. \u201cIt was also important that it was straightforward to adapt the portal to reflect York\u2019s brand and to support a French language interface for Glendon, our bilingual campus.\u201d   Building a Student Portal     In the first phase, York focused on the integration of its many data sources (grades, student records, repositories of course and financial information) with Liferay\u2019s framework. Today, My.Yorku.ca is the central information source for 55,000 students and     supports up to 18,000 visits per day. The site offers access to both internal resources and external data, including:           Class and grade information      Financial account information      Library account information      A personalized exam schedule      Research published guides for courses      To-do lists and bookmarks      Personalized class calendar      University email and personal IMAP email accounts      Daily news and information from the campus          In subsequent phases, York University rolled out a convenient portal for prospective students (myfuture.yorku.ca) and provided integration of the learning management system Moodle for easy access to online course content. My.Yorku.ca has also gone mobile for viewing and navigation on users\u2019 smartphones.     \u201cWhen students understand the resources available to help them succeed at York, they are more likely to graduate, which is of course one of York\u2019s primary goals,\u201d Rowley said.     At the end-user level, Liferay Portal\u2019s granular system of role-based authorizations grants each individual user the ability to move, add or delete the tools in his\/her own view to suit their needs. Looking forward, York University will explore Liferay\u2019s new collaboration tools for use in portals to be built for York\u2019s staff and instructors.","keywords":["York","York University","students","students","portal","students","Liferay Portal","world","paths","success","IT organization","portal","students","graduate","Canada","institution","students","faculties","retention","size","undergraduate degree programs","My.Yorku.ca","Peter Rowley","SOA","Student Portal","Issues","information","standards","students","Kate Stewart","Glendon","tools","grades","content","Moodle","sense","user interface","goals","campus news","course schedules","user","application integration","information","frustration","website","Integration","hub","library account status","flexibility","degree","interface","integration","tools","course","content","grades","students","portal","data sources","use","ease","framework","need","pains","framework","phase","variety","audience","project","design","selection","adherence","standards compliance","open source solution","commitment","course","users","language","brand","student records","repositories","course content","portals","integration","access","viewing","resources","goals","navigation","smartphones","ability","tools","collaboration tools","University Information Technology","view","system","needs","instructors","use","French","site","Library","information","information","authorizations","level","staff","courses","grade","lists","campus","email","phases","Class","data","resources","access","information","visits","class calendar","bookmarks","guides","exam schedule Research","email","Daily news","IMAP"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=edf","text":"Previously, EDF Group had more than 400 intranet sites scattered all over the world.

It consolidates online human resources, education and training information in an interface that is personalized according to preferences and rank.   In 2014, the Navy wanted to expand the portal to users in the entire navy, rather than a small subset. This required opening up the system to 870,000 potential users, and the existing solution couldn\u2019t deliver the necessary performance levels to make that a reality.     A large part of the problem was that the portal was composed of several different systems and databases. Finally, the Navy decided to move everything to a single solution that could meet their performance requirements and deliver a great digital experience. It chose the development team at Team Katmai to implement everything on the Liferay platform, which already had buy-in from commanders and captains because of its known name. The extensibility in Liferay, as well as the ample community support and paid support, were also key to selection.     Award-Winning Performance and FedRAMP Certification     Team Katmai\u2019s first task was to do a complete rewrite of the codebase and re-architect the system for both better performance and an improved user experience. One major advantage of Liferay was how easily it worked in the Amazon Web Services cloud environment. Team Katmai was able to receive FedRAMP certification for the portal and deploy it within the Amazon Government Cloud, and can now take advantage of AWS security and development tools.     The new portal launched with the ability to serve 40,000 sailors signing on at once within ten minutes, the site\u2019s highest traffic level. When tested, the new Liferay portal held up to this spike in users. In the future, Team Katmai plans to increase performance so the site can handle 50,000 and higher users in less than two minutes over the Navy\/Marine Corps intranet network.     The Department of Defense was so impressed with the new My Navy site that it awarded Team Katmai a CIO award, the first time this award has ever gone to a contractor.     User Satisfaction Jumps in a Restrictive Environment     The final product that Team Katmai delivered is still evolving. As the Navy comes up with new feature requests or changes to the UI, Team Katmai can quickly implement them without disrupting what users see. The Navy\u2019s administrators are able to manage all content independently without getting involved on the technical side.     Users praise the new portal for its ease of use, visual design and stellar performance, which can be difficult to achieve with the security and network restrictions in the Navy\/Marine Corps intranet. Team Katmai has plans for plugging in more external systems from other DoD interfaces so that My Navy Portal is a true one-stop shop for every Navy need.","keywords":["United States Navy","Navy Portal","sailors","FedRAMP Certification Team Katmai","interface","military service","careers","navy","users","portal","platform","system","preferences","training information","education","human resources","rank","advantage","certification","solution","Liferay","users","portal","systems","part","Performance","performance levels","everything","solution","Team","My Navy","development team","Team Katmai","portal","performance","subset","portal","reality","users","problem","databases","system","Team Katmai","rewrite","portal","site","advantage","site","user experience","Web Services cloud environment","performance requirements","experience","everything","commanders","support","community support","Katmai a CIO","security","sailors","traffic level","portal","task","codebase","name","captains","selection","development tools","Government","ability","spike","Users","Navy\/Marine Corps","Environment","feature requests","content","Amazon","performance","award","product","changes","side","administrators","systems","users","Cloud","shop","My Navy Portal","intranet","network","security","interfaces","AWS","Team","ease","use","design","restrictions","need","plans","users","performance","extensibility","UI","site","intranet network","contractor","time","User Satisfaction","Department of Defense"]},{"url":"https:\/\/www.liferay.com\/resource?title=msa","text":"The MSA (Mutualit\u00e9 Sociale Agricole), ranked as the second largest social security system in France, provides social cover for the entire agricultural population and their families.
